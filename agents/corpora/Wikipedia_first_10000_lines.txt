e.
 without and archos i.
e.
 leader ruler cf.
 archon or arkh i.
e.
 authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein .
 the first known use of this word was in one five three nine .
 various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the h bertists although few shared many views of later anarchists.
 there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.
 the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century.
 since the one eight nine zero s and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the one nine five zero s in the united states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states.
 on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism .
 history origins woodcut from a diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the six th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan.
 zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist.
 zhuangzi wrote a petty thief is put in jail.
 a great becomes a ruler of a nation.
 diogenes of sinope and the cynics their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics.
 jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition.
 georges lechartier wrote that the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and .
.
.
 the first anarchist society was that of the apostles .
 in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society.
 later some muslim scholars such as amer al basri and abu hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the waqf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs.
 but such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible .
 this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry .
 the french renaissance political philosopher tienne de la bo tie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.
 the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the one seven th century in england.
 the term anarchist first entered the english language in one six four two during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents.
 by the time of the french revolution some such as the enrag s began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoron ic.
 by the turn of the one nine th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation.
 modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
 as part of the political turmoil of the one seven nine zero s in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought .
 godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke .
 upright william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work .
 godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism .
 he argued in political justice one seven nine three that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.
 he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force.
 although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power.
 rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
 his aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage.
 he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation.
 in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
 the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in one eight four zero .
 it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.
 he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order.
 in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft .
 in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish.
 he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use.
 later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.
 his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
 the anarcho communist joseph d jacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian .
 unlike pierre joseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature.
 in one eight four four in germany the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism .
 french anarchists active in the one eight four eight revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph d jacque and pierre joseph proudhon .
 first international and the paris commune upright collectivist anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists.
 in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.
 after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt.
 in spain ram n de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coru a in one eight four five which was inspired by proudhon s ideas.
 the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon s works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in one eight seven three while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party.
 according to george woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after one eight seven zero but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early one eight six zero s.
 according to the encyclopedia britannica during the spanish revolution of one eight seven three pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines.
 in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats .
 due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organisation.
 karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council.
 proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.
 woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b.
 greene had been members of the first international .
 in one eight six eight following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf .
 they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
 at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction.
 subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads.
 bakunin characterised marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against.
 anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in one eight seven zero owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in one eight seven one the general council called only a special conference in london.
 one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the f d ration romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin s swiss supporters.
 thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council s resolutions passed almost unanimously.
 most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers.
 in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york.
 in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st.
 imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
 the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from one eight march more formally from two eight march to two eight may one eight seven one .
 the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war.
 anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune.
 they included george woodcock states organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organisation of labour.
 in one eight eight six the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set one may one eight eight six as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard.
 upright a sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair .
 the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances.
 in response unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event.
 on three may in chicago a fight broke out when strikebreaker s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.
 the next day four may anarchists staged a rally at chicago s haymarket square.
 a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer.
 in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other.
 seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.
 eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer.
 the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement.
 four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution.
 the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day.
 in one eight nine zero a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made.
 the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair.
 although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday.
 in one nine zero seven the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from one four different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri beno t broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen .
 various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism .
 a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade union ism .
 malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.
 he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.
 malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
 the spanish workers federation in one eight eight one was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain.
 the most successful was the confederaci n nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in one nine one zero .
 before the one nine four zero s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting one .
 five eight million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war .
 the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in one nine two two with delegates representing two million workers from one five countries in europe and latin america.
 in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early one nine two zero s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish c.
n.
t.
 as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation.
 the largest and most militant of these organizations was the federaci n obrera regional argentina .
.
.
 it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.
 propaganda of the deed and illegalism upright italian american anarchist luigi galleani .
 his followers known as galleanists carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from one nine one four to one nine three two in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda.
 by the one eight eight zero s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicide s and tyrannicide s.
 from one nine zero five onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations .
 illegalism as a practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society.
 moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt.
 .
 france s bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
 however as soon as one eight eight seven important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts.
 peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le r volt that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite .
 a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement.
 the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in one eight nine five for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter.
 state repression including the infamous one eight nine four french lois sc l rates of the anarchist and labour movement s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts.
 the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the one eight seven one paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts.
 historian benedict anderson thus writes in march one eight seven one the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months.
 then versailles seized the moment to attack and in one horrifying week executed roughly two zero zero zero zero communards or suspected sympathizers a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during robespierre s terror of one seven nine three one seven nine four .
 more than seven five zero zero were jailed or deported to places like new caledonia.
 thousands of others fled to belgium england italy spain and the united states.
 in one eight seven two stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left.
 not till one eight eight zero was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards.
 meanwhile the third republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce louis napoleon s imperialist expansion in indochina africa and oceania.
 many of france s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune courbet was its quasi minister of culture rimbaud and pissarro were active propagandists or were sympathetic to it.
 the ferocious repression of one eight seven one and thereafter was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.
 according to some analysts in post war germany the prohibition of the communist party kdp and thus of institutional far left political organisation may also in the same manner have played a role in the creation of the red army faction .
 numerous heads of state were assassinated between one eight eight one and one nine one four by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto i of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece .
 mckinley s assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman .
 propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after world war i one nine one four one nine one eight and the one nine one seven october revolution .
 russian revolution and other uprisings of the one nine one zero s nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolshevik s in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution.
 however following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the one nine two one kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed.
 anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine .
 there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
 expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia.
 both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised.
 for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
 the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally.
 many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements.
 in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international .
 the revolutionary wave of one nine one seven two three saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism.
 in the german uprising known as the german revolution of one nine one eight one nine one nine which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich m hsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures.

 in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism.
 their one nine two six manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported.
 platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america.
 synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives .
 in the one nine two zero s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure .
 it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .

 spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union confederaci n nacional del trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory.

 the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in one nine three six and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante .
 much of spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as seven five but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment.
 factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes .
 anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history.

 anarchist schools of thought upright portrait of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon one eight zero nine one eight six five by gustave courbet .
 proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.
 anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution.
 the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i.
e.
 opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement .
 in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the one nine th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid two zero th century and after.
 beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.
 a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.
 one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del m rmol in one eight eight nine in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.
 in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i.
e.
 collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
 classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in one eight th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states.
 proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order.
 it is important to recognize that proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance.
 for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
 mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform.
 according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount.
 mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.

 proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property.
 individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems.
 individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
 in one seven nine three william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism.
 godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.
 godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
 one nine th century philosopher max stirner usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels .
 an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner .
 stirner s the ego and its own published in one eight four four is a founding text of the philosophy.
 according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality.
 to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality .
 stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state .
 egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.
 egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner s philosophy.
 it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and lgbt activist john henry mackay .
 josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during one eight three three the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published.
 for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent .
.
.
 that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as one eight four eight and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews .
.

 william b.
 greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.
 .
 henry david thoreau one eight one seven one eight six two was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe.
 thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist .
 he is best known for his books walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.
 later benjamin tucker fused stirner s egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty .
 from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france .
 these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others.
 social anarchism social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion .
 it is the largest school of thought in anarchism.
 social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid .
 collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most .
 collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.
 this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
 however collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism.
 this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively uphold ing the wages system .
 collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.
 anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
 anarcho communism anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state market s money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary association s and workers council s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need .
 upright russian theorist peter kropotkin one eight four two one nine two one who was influential in the development of anarchist communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.
 most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
 anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international .
 the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organisationalist and insurrectionary anti organisationalist sections.
 to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i.
e.
 established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution .
 through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in one nine three six anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself.
 during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from one nine one nine before being conquered by the bolsheviks in one nine two one .
 anarcho syndicalism may day demonstration of spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in two zero one zero anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement .
 anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers.
 the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves.
 moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing.
 they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.
 rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement.
 he outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his one nine three eight pamphlet anarcho syndicalism .
 the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.
 the spanish confederaci n nacional del trabajo played and still plays a major role in the spanish labour movement .
 it was also an important force in the spanish civil war .
 post classical schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors.
 zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while jarach is a noted advocate of post left anarchy .
 anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
 green anarchism or eco anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology .
 anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism .
 it generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association .
 anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state .
 in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa.
 l.
 susan brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist .
 anarcha feminism began with the late one nine th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre .
 anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence .
 it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war .

 its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul .
 platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda s organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft .
 the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the one nine one seven october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups.
 the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the russian revolution .
 synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives .
 in the one nine two zero s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and s bastien faure .
 it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .
 post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional left wing politics .
 some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality .
 influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
 insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice.
 it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses.
 instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation.
 insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
 post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy situationist international and postcolonialism .
 left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labor positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy.
 anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market .
 anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory .
 there is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
 internal issues and debates which forms of violence if any are consistent with anarchist values is a controversial subject among anarchists.
 anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common.
 the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed.
 similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism and capitalism .
 anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
 phenomena such as civilization technology e.

 the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society.
 about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones.
 the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory .
 topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
 free love upright french individualist anarchist emile armand one eight seven two one nine six two who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early two zero th century an important current within anarchism is free love .
 free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual s sovereignty.
 free love particularly stressed women s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures.
 the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer one eight eight three one nine zero seven edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood s the word one eight seven two one eight nine zero one eight nine two one eight nine three .

 libertarian education and freethought upright francesc ferrer i gu rdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved.
 godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.
 for godwin education had to have a respect for the child s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion a pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child s own motivation and initiatives and a concern about the child s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school.
 in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government .

 murray bookchin wrote this period one eight nine zero s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence.
 perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer s modern school escuela moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.
 la escuela moderna and ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london.
 the first of these was started in new york city in one nine one one .
 it also inspired the italian newspaper universit popolare founded in one nine zero one .
 russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate.

 education is culture under restraint culture is free.
 education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary .

 neill founding what became summerhill school in one nine two one .
 summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.
 however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach.
 in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se.
 the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
 criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms.
 anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics.
 european history professor carl landauer in his book european socialism argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force.
 he also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity.

 parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life.
 these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress .
 the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood typically before age three.
 while autism is highly heritable researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes.
 in rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects .
 controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven.
 autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cell s and their synapse s connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood.
 it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum asds the other two being asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as pdd nos which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome are not met.
 early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills.
 although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered.
 not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful.
 an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder .
 globally autism is estimated to affect two one .
 seven million people as of two zero one three .
 as of two zero one zero the number of people affected is estimated at about one two per one zero zero zero worldwide.
 it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls.

 the rate of autism among adults aged one eight years and over in the united kingdom is one .
 one .
 the number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the one nine eight zero s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.
 characteristics autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission .
 people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal or even superior in others.
 overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form.
 it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior.
 other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.
 autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.
 social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorder s asd see classification from other developmental disorders.
 people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted.
 noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypical s or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars .
 unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.
 autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name.
 autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things.
 three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others.
 however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers.
 most childen with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd.
 older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to defines a person s own emotions.
 children with high functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone.
 making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism.
 for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel.
 functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply.
 there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd.
 the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrum s.
 communication about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.
 differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver.
 in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words.
 children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns .
 joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.
 children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.
 in a pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged eight one five performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling.
 both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference.
 as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.
 repetitive behavior autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r categorizes as follows.
 alt young boy asleep on a bed facing the camera with only the head visible and the body off camera.
 on the bed behind the boy s head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.
 a young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking.
 compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
 sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
 ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual.
 this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.
 restricted behavior is limited in focus interest or activity such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game.
 self injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging.
 no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.
 other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family.
 an estimated zero .
 five to one zero of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skill s such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants .
 many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population.
 sensory abnormalities are found in over nine zero of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.
 differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements .
 an estimated six zero eight zero of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper.
 unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator.
 selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition .
 although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptom s there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear.
 parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress .
 siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship.
 however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
 causes it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms.
 however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur.
 alt three diagrams of chromosome pairs a b that are nearly identical.
 one b is missing a segment of a.
 two b has two adjacent copies of a segment of a.
 three b s copy of a s segment is in reverse order.
 deletion one duplication two and inversion three are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism.
 autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutation s with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.
 complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression .
 studies of twins suggest that heritability is zero .
 seven for autism and as high as zero .
 nine for asd and siblings of those with autism are about two five times more likely to be autistic than the general population.
 however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified.
 typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd.
 numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene.
 the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variation s spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis .
 hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.
 several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism.
 some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion .
 gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes.
 all known teratogen s agents that cause birth defect s related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.
 exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism.
 environmental factor s that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease s solvent s diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticide s brominated flame retardant s alcohol smoking illicit drug s vaccine s and prenatal stress although no links have been found and some have been completely disproven.
 parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination.
 this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism.
 the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud .
 although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children.
 mechanism autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain.
 how autism occurs is not well understood.
 its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors.
 the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.
 pathophysiology alt two diagrams of major brain structures implicated in autism.
 the upper diagram shows the cerebral cortex near the top and the basal ganglia in the center just above the amygdala and hippocampus.
 the lower diagram shows the corpus callosum near the center the cerebellum in the lower rear and the brain stem in the lower center.
 autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain.
 unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms.
 autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product.
 neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.
 this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors.
 just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood.
 it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism.
 it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization.
 hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following an excess of neuron s that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions.
 disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation .
 unbalanced excitatory inhibitory networks.
 abnormal formation of synapse s and dendritic spine s for example by modulation of the neurexin neuroligin cell adhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins.
 disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated.
 the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism.
 children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia .
 biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication.
 interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response.
 it is thought that activation of a pregnant mother s immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development.
 this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism.
 the relationship of neurochemical s to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport.
 the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors mglur in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway.
 some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormone s or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptor s.
 also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than five of cases.
 the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties.
 the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action.
 the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions.
 several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd.
 however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
 upright alt a human brain viewed from above.
 about one zero is highlighted in yellow and one zero in blue.
 there is only a tiny perhaps zero .
 five green region where they overlap.
 autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue .
 asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
 in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking .
 in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought.
 the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes.
 evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex.
 other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex .
 from studies based on event related potential s transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.
 for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals.
 in the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with one q two one .
 one deletion syndrome .
 research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome one five one five q one three .
 three chromosome one six one six p one three .
 one and chromosome one seven one seven p one two are inconclusive.
 neuropsychology two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.
 the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition .
 simon baron cohen s empathizing systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.
 an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.
 these theories are somewhat related to baron cohen s earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others.
 the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sally anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis.
 however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints.
 the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition .
 in his review kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism .
 tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels.
 a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.
 weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism.
 one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.
 a related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals.
 these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.
 neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.
 a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.
 diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism.
 under the dsm five autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities.
 these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment.
 sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects.
 the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay.
 icd one zero uses essentially the same definition.
 several diagnostic instruments are available.
 two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child.
 the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.
 a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child.
 if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions .
 a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.
 a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome .
 the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression .
 clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.
 although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated four zero of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing.
 a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations.
 as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge.
 commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics.
 metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine.
 asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age one four months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later.
 in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most three zero weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.
 although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.
 underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices.
 the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms.
 conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.
 it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindism s.
 classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorder s pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.
 these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance.
 of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.
 unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development .
 the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism .
 in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably.
 asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact.
 the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication.
 because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.
 sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.
 autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis .
 although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear.
 some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from one five to three zero months of age.
 the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.
 research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics .
 newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotype s observable traits that can be viewed on brain scan s to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.
 it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.
 screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age one eight months and about four fifths notice by age two four months.
 according to an article in the journal of autism and developmental disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations.
 delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome .
 no babbling by one two months.
 no gesturing pointing waving etc.
 by one two months.
 no single words by one six months.
 no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by two four months.
 any loss of any language or social skills at any age.
 us and japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at one eight and two four months using autism specific formal screening tests.
 in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened.
 it is not known which approach is more effective.
 screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged one eight three zero months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives .
 it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders.
 screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.
 although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic feature s.
 prevention infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than one of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases.
 management alt a young child points in front of a woman who smiles and points in the same direction.
 a three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development.
 the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence.
 in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes.
 no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs.
 families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment.
 studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years.
 although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic review s of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options.
 intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.
 available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy .
 among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit.
 there is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention eibi an early intervention model based on aba for two zero to four zero hours a week for multiple years is an effective treatment for some children with asd.
 two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis aba and developmental social pragmatic models dsp .
 one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves.
 various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation.
 despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.
 education educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children.
 similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes an aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well established treatment in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms.
 neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided.
 it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.
 the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.
 medication many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails.
 more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drug s or anticonvulsant s with the most common drug classes being antidepressant s stimulant s and antipsychotic s.
 antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been found to be useful for treating irritability repetitive behavior and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism.
 there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd.
 a person with asd may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments.
 experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.
 alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies.
 treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance.
 scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests.
 some alternative treatments may place the child at risk.

 there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatment s in children with autism.
 although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism there is no good evidence that a gluten free diet is of benefit.
 in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviours.
 cost treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so.

 us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance.
 after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning .
 society and culture the rainbow colored infinity is often used as a symbol for the diversity of the autism spectrum as well as neurodiversity in general.
 the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism.
 through this movement people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease.
 proponents of this movement wish to seek acceptance not cures.
 there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day light it up blue autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others.
 there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone s life.
 these organizations include autism speaks autism national committee autism society of america and many others.
 social science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements.
 media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism.
 rain man a film that won four oscars depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities.
 while many autistics don t have these special abilities there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields.
 prognosis there is no known cure.
 children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not.
 it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from three to two five .
 most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years.
 most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination .
 although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age.
 few high quality studies address long term prognosis .
 some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife.
 acquiring language before age six having an iq above five zero and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism.

 this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.

 several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.
 although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.
 the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.
 most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.
 several other conditions are common in children with autism.
 they include genetic disorder s .
 about one zero one five of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders.
 intellectual disability .
 the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from two five to seven zero a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.
 in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger s excludes intellectual disability.
 anxiety disorder s are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from one one to eight four .
 many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd s symptoms.
 epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder .
 several metabolic defect s such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms.
 minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population.
 preempted diagnoses .
 although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted.
 sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood.
 these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings.
 sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis.

 leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three .
 a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named.
 the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a one two year old boy who may have been severely autistic.
 luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.
 the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a one seven four seven court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance.
 the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in one seven nine eight showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.
 the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in one nine one zero as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia .
 he derived it from the greek word aut s meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance .
 the word autism first took its modern sense in one nine three eight when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology .
 asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until one nine eight one .
 leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a one nine four three report of one one children with striking behavioral similarities.
 almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.
 it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger.
 kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mother s .
 starting in the late one nine six zero s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.
 as late as the mid one nine seven zero s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.
 although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child s autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others and many primary care physician s and medical specialist s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.
 the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.
 sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .

 it is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it.
 its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to one for perfect reflection of a white surface.
 note since it is the ratio of all reflected radiation to incident radiation it will include the diffuse and the specular radiation reflected.
 it is however common to assume a surface reflects in either a totally specular manner or a totally diffuse manner as this can simplify calculations.
 albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation.
 when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light .
 in general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation except for lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution.
 in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.
 the albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainable rating systems for buildings.
 the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is three zero to three five because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.
 the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his one seven six zero work photometria .
 terrestrial albedo albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to zero .
 nine for fresh snow to about zero .
 zero four for charcoal one of the darkest substances.
 deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body .
 when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms.
 most land areas are in an albedo range of zero .
 one to zero .
 four .
 the average albedo of earth is about zero .
 three .
 this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.
 two zero zero three two zero zero four mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites.
 as the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e.
g.
 .
 earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about one five c.
 if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below four zero c.
 if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about zero c.
 in contrast if the entire earth is covered by water a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under two seven c.
 white sky and black sky albedo it has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle i can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle and the bi hemispherical reflectance bar the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination .
 albedo can then be given as one d bar alpha theta i d bar .
 directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo.
 these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.
 astronomical albedo the albedos of planet s satellites and asteroid s can be used to infer much about their properties.
 the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry .
 for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos.
 for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroid s.
 enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with nine nine of em radiation reflected.
 another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of zero .
 nine six .
 many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about zero .
 zero five .
 a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of zero .
 zero four .
 such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compound s.
 the overall albedo of the moon is around zero .
 one two but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect .
 although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies.
 two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected .
 their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion.
 in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces.
 the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is a left frac right two where a is the astronomical albedo d is the diameter in kilometers and h is the absolute magnitude.
 examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination although the albedo temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater.
 the maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north.
 the minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.
 insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation.
 tropical and sub tropical rain forest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation.
 because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.
 climate and weather albedo affects climate and drives weather .
 all weather is a result of the uneven heating of earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos.
 essentially for the driving of weather there are two types of albedo regions on earth land and ocean.
 land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of air masses depending on latitude and therefore insolation warm and dry which form over tropical and sub tropical land masses warm and wet which form over tropical and sub tropical oceans cold and dry which form over temperate polar and sub polar land masses and cold and wet which form over temperate polar and sub polar oceans.
 different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures and the masses develop into pressure systems .
 high pressure systems flow toward lower pressure driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere and south to north in the lower however due to the spinning of earth the coriolis effect further complicates flow and creates several weather climate bands and the jet stream s.
 albedo temperature feedback when an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results.
 a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling.
 in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e.
g.
 a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback.
 however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of season s eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting.
 when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating.
 snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as zero .
 nine for freshly fallen snow to about zero .
 four for melting snow and as low as zero .
 two for dirty snow.
 over antarctica they average a little more than zero .
 eight .
 if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback .
 cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
 hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.
 small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too.
 in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.
 solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic device s.
 for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a si h and crystalline silicon c si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions.
 research showed impacts of over one zero .
 more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of two two commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications.
 trees because forests generally have a low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation .
 in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.
 trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration .
 the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are one zero to five zero higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.
 deciduous trees have an albedo value of about zero .
 one five to zero .
 one eight whereas coniferous trees have a value of about zero .
 zero nine to zero .
 one five .
 studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests.
 they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e.

 siberia were neutral or perhaps warming.
 water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials.
 the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph .
 reflectivity of smooth water at two zero c refractive index one .
 three three three at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely .
 the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this.
 at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs.
 incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.
 although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles .
 however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction.
 because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.
 note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities.
 fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection.
 clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures.
 different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near zero to a maximum approaching zero .
 eight .
 on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water.
 clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.
 albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrail s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.
 a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as one zero c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.
 aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth s radiative balance.
 the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain.
 as per the effects are aerosol direct effect.
 aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation.
 the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
 aerosol indirect effect.
 aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei .
 increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect .
 black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles.
 the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is zero .

 black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.

 deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe.
 however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.
 other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles.
 it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

 it is similar to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives.
 the upper case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar.
 the lower case version can be written in two forms the double storey a and single storey .
 the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children.
 it is also found in italic type .
 history the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonant s for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet .
 in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.
 in one six zero zero b.
c.
e.
 the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms.
 its name must have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph.
 when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha .
 in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the eight th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set.
 the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged.
 the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english.
 typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter a.
 during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a .
 first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums.
 there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces.
 due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there as not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule.
 variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles.
 the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial.
 typographic variants include a double storey a and single storey .
 at the end of the roman empire five th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe.
 among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain.
 by the nine th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press.
 this form was derived through a combining of prior forms.
 one five th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today.
 these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version.
 the italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke.
 this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers.
 most printed material uses the roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it .
 both derive from the majuscule capital form.
 in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown.
 many fonts then made the right leg vertical.
 in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form.
 italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type .
 however there are also some other cases aside from this where script a also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin a such as in the international phonetic alphabet .
 use in writing systems english in modern english orthography the letter represents seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is followed by one or occasionally two consonants and then another vowel letter this results from middle english lengthening followed by the great vowel shift the modified form of the above sound that occurs before as in square and mary the rounded vowel of water the shorter rounded vowel not present in general american in was and what a schwa in many unstressed syllables as in about comma solar .

 two two in spanish and three .
 nine five in french.
 other languages in most languages that use the latin alphabet denotes an open unrounded vowel such as or .
 an exception is saanich in which and the glyph stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel .
 other systems in phonetic and phonemic notation in the international phonetic alphabet is used for the open front unrounded vowel is used for the open central unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel .
 in x sampa is used for the open front unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel .
 other uses in algebra the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities.
 in geometry capital a b c etc.
 are used to denote segment s line s rays etc.
 a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a.
 in logic a is used to signify the universal affirmative .
 in physics a is the si unit symbol for ampere .
 a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a a or a the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork a grade for clean restaurants a list celebrities etc.
 such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters.
 finally the letter a is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere .

 from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many southern states suffered economic hardship in part because of continued dependence on agriculture.
 despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature from one nine zero one to the one nine six zero s as it did not regularly reapportion the legislature from one nine zero one to one nine six one urban interests and african americans were markedly under represented.
 african americans and poor whites were essentially disenfranchised altogether by the state constitution of one nine zero one a status that continued into the mid one nine six zero s before being alleviated by federal legislation.
 exclusion of minorities continued under at large voting systems in most counties some changes were made through a series of omnibus court cases in the late one nine eight zero s to establish different electoral systems.
 following world war ii alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.
 the power of the solid south in congress gained the establishment or expansion of multiple united states armed forces installations which helped to bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid two zero th century.

 the european american naming of the alabama river and state originates from the alabama people a muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river.
 in the alabama language the word for an alabama person is albaamo or variously albaama or alb amo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha .
 the word alabama is believed to have come from the related choctaw language and was adopted by the alabama tribe as their name.
 the spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources.
 the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of one five four zero with garcilaso de la vega using alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in efforts to transliterate the term.
 as early as one seven zero two the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivi re des alibamons .
 other spellings of the appellation have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou .
 and possibly alabahmu .
 the use of state names derived from native american languages is common an estimated two seven states have names of native american origin.
 sources disagree on the meaning of the word.
 an one eight four two article in the jacksonville republican proposed that it meant here we rest.
 this notion was popularized in the one eight five zero s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek .
 experts in the muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.
 scholars believe the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather .
 the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants.
 the state has numerous place names of native american origin .

 they wrote another constitution in one eight seven five and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools.
 the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools.
 railroad passenger cars were segregated in one eight nine one .
 after disfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the one nine zero one constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the two zero th century to impose segregation in everyday life.
 two zero th century the developing skyline of birmingham in one nine one five the new one nine zero one constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll taxes and literacy test .
 by one nine zero three only two nine eight zero african americans were registered in alabama although at least seven four zero zero zero were literate .
 this compared to more than one eight one zero zero zero african americans eligible to vote in one nine zero zero .
 the numbers dropped even more in later decades.
 while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.
 by one nine four one whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws six zero zero zero zero zero whites vs.
 five two zero zero zero zero african americans.
 nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote.
 despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement.
 the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the one nine six five to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.
 the one nine zero one constitution required racial segregation of public schools.
 it also restated that interracial marriage was illegal as it had been prohibited in one eight six seven .
 into the one nine five zero s the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities jails were segregated in one nine one one hospitals in one nine one five toilets hotels and restaurants in one nine two eight and bus stop waiting rooms in one nine four five .
 the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.
 partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald school s.
 in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs.
 the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest.
 black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas.
 they often donated land and labor as well.
 the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in one nine one nine .
 it was one of the three eight seven rosenwald schools built in the state.
 beginning in one nine one three the first eight zero rosenwald school s were built in alabama for african american children.
 a total of three eight seven schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by one nine three seven in the state.
 several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places .
 continued racial discrimination and lynching s agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the two zero th century as part of the great migration out of the south.
 reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from one nine one zero to one nine two zero .
 at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs.
 birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city .
 by the one nine two zero s birmingham was the one nine th largest city in the united states and had more than three zero of the state s population.
 heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.
 its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution.
 this did not change until the late one nine six zero s following a lawsuit and court order.
 beginning in the one nine four zero s when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters.
 the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants.
 black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the fifteenth amendment .
 the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to a two eight sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits.
 the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution.
 in one nine six one .
.
.
 the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.
 industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.
 rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.
 one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile.
 between one nine four zero and one nine four three more than eight nine zero zero zero people moved into the city to work for war related industries.
 cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.
 despite massive population changes in the state from one nine zero one to one nine six one the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses.
 they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
 in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham.
 one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services.
 urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature.
 a one nine six zero study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about two five per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature.
 a class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislature s lack of redistricting for congressional seats.
 in one nine six two white v.
 crook judge frank m.
 johnson ordered the state to redistrict.
 united states supreme court cases of baker v.
 carr one nine six two and reynolds v.
 sims one nine six four ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate.
 in one nine seven two for the first time since one nine zero one the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census.
 this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than six zero years.
 other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.
 african americans continued to press in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges.
 in one nine five four the us supreme court ruled in brown v.
 board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply.
 during the one nine six zero s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation .
the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott one nine five five five six freedom rides in one nine six one and one nine six five selma to montgomery marches .
 these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of one nine six four and voting rights act of one nine six five by the u.
s.
 congress.
 legal segregation ended in the states in one nine six four but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.
 despite recommendations of a one nine seven three alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties.
 there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county level functions and policies.
 this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.
 alabama has made some changes since the late two zero th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
 in the one nine eight zero s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v.
 crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of one eight zero alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards.
 at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats.
 despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions.
 as part of settlement of this case five alabama cites and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions.
 this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters.
 in another form of proportional representation two three jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county .
 in one nine eight two limited voting was first tested in conecuh county .
 together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.

 this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas.
 for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only one six seven th of state services in funding.

 all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party.
 there are two intermediate appellate court s the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial court s the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts.

 taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax and can do so even if taking the standard deduction .
 taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax social security and medicare tax .
 the state s general sales tax rate is four .
 sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.

 county and local governments alabama has six seven counties .
 each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission.
 it also has limited executive authority in the county.
 because of the constraints of the alabama constitution only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule .
 instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.
 the cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems and the state legislators are buried in local county issues.
 the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the one nine seven three alabama constitutional commission.
 legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county.
 united states supreme court decisions in baker v.
 carr one nine six four required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote .
 before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties.
 the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution.
 alabama s constitution has been amended more than seven zero zero times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city.
 a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.

 in one eight seven four the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african american vote through violence fraud and intimidation.
 after one eight nine zero a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the one nine zero one constitution.
 provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites.
 by one nine four one more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised six zero zero zero zero zero to five two zero zero zero zero .
 the total effects were greater on the african american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.
 from one nine zero one through the one nine six zero s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas.
 as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in one nine seven two to meet equal representation.
 alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s during the american civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform.

 only after passage of the federal civil rights act of one nine six four and voting rights act of one nine six five did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights.

 in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office.
 members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office.

 in that general election the then incumbent chief justice of alabama ernest c.
 hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately three zero zero zero votes to republican perry o.

 reverse thetis wearing chiton and holding shield of achilles with his ax monogram.
 in greek mythology achilles akhilleus was a greek hero of the trojan war and the central character and greatest warrior of homer s iliad .
 his mother was the nymph thetis and his father peleus was the king of the myrmidons .
 achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan hero hector outside the gates of troy .
 although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow.
 later legends beginning with a poem by statius in the one st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel.
 because of his death from a small wound in the heel the term achilles heel has come to mean a person s point of weakness.
 etymology achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos grief and laos a people tribe nation.
 in other words achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the iliad frequently by achilles .
 achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of kleos glory usually glory in war .
 laos has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster .
 with this derivation the name would have a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war.
 the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.
 r.
 s.
 p.
 beekes has suggested a pre greek origin of the name.
 the name achilleus was a common and attested name among the greeks soon after the seven th century bc.
 it was also turned into the female form achille a attested in attica in the four th century bc ig ii one six one seven and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon .
 birth thetis dipping the infant achilles into the river styx ca.
 one six two five peter paul rubens achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus the king of the myrmidons .
 zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father.
 for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus.
 there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in argonautica iv.
 seven six zero zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus that thetis was so loyal to hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.
 thetis although a daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus.
 the education of achilles ca.
 one seven seven two by james barry according to the achilleid written by statius in the one st century ad and to no surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx .
 however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his heel see achilles heel achilles tendon .
 it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier.
 in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body.
 she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.
 however none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.
 to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book two one the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander.
 he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood .
 also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which we can find description of the hero s death cypria unknown author aithiopis by arctinus of miletus little iliad by lesche of mytilene iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness heel in the later vase paintings presenting achilles death the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his body.

 achilles in the trojan war the rage of achilles by giovanni battista tiepolo the first two lines of the iliad read sing goddess of the rage of peleus son achilles the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans .
 achilles consuming rage is at times wavering but at other times he cannot be cooled.
 the humanization of achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.
 according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with five zero ships each carrying five zero myrmidons book two .
 he appointed five leaders each leader commanding five zero zero myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon book one six .
 telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus .
 in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal .
 guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy.
 according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound.
 achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge.
 alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound.
 odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it.
 pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed.
 troilus according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighboring cities and killed troilus .
 in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priam s or sometimes apollo and hecuba s five legitimate sons.
 despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders.
 prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him.
 yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo.
 later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace.
 in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.
 ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.
 had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible.
 achilles in the iliad achilles sacrificing to zeus from the ambrosian iliad a five th century illuminated manuscript homer s iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war.
 achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem.
 the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war and does not narrate achilles death.
 it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces.
 agamemnon had taken a woman named chryseis as his slave.
 her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him.
 agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks.
 the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him.
 achilles does so and calchas declares chryseis must be returned to her father.
 agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis be brought to him to replace chryseis.
 angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loved briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces.
 at this same time burning with rage over agamemnon s theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honor.
 as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior.
 agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts.
 achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.
 the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships.
 with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armor though achilles remains at his camp.
 patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy.
 triumphant achilles dragging hector s lifeless body in front of the gates of troy from a panoramic fresco on the upper level of the main hall of the achilleion .
 after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companion s death and holds many funeral games in his honor.
 his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles.
 she persuades hephaestus to make new armor for him in place of the armor that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector.
 the new armor includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem.
 enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector.
 achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who becomes angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed.
 the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus.
 zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself.
 finally achilles finds his prey.
 achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector s favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face.
 after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable.
 wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses.
 accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him.
 achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me .
 achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot during patroclus funeral games.
 with the assistance of the god hermes hector s father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector s body so that he can be buried.
 achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral.
 the poem ends with a description of hector s funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come.
 penthesilea achilles after his temporary truce with priam fought and killed the amazonian warrior queen penthesilea but later grieved over her death.
 at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual.
 once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her.
 memnon and the fall of achilles achilles dying in the gardens of the achilleion in corfu following the death of patroclus achilles closest companion was nestor s son antilochus .
 when memnon king of ethiopia slew antilochus achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield killing memnon.
 the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess.
 many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliad s description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it.
 the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the seven th century b.
c.
 the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.
 the death of achilles as predicted by hector with his dying breath was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius .
 in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow.
 some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.
 ajax carries off the body of achilles attic black figure lekythos ca.
 five one zero bc from sicily staatliche antikensammlungen munich all of these versions deny paris any sort of valor owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield.
 his bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held.
 he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube .
 another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena .
 achilles asks priam for polyxena s hand in marriage.
 priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world s greatest warrior.
 but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him.
 achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus.
 paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles .
 fate of achilles armor achilles armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater .
 they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of odysseus.
 furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned the ire of athena.
 athena temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades.
 after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide.
 odysseus eventually gave the armor to neoptolemus the son of achilles.
 a relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf.
 the city was visited in three three three bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear.

 five zero zero bc achilles ajax and a game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions.
 at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing a board game petteia .
 they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle.
 the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena.
 achilles and patroclus the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.
 in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship.
 homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers.
 despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors.
 commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures.
 in five th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia .
 in plato s symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover.
 but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.
 worship of achilles in antiquity achilles and briseis penthesilea brought her amazon warriors to help the trojans defend their city but was killed in combat by achilles.
 here achilles looms above her as she sinks to the ground.
 there was an archaic heroic cult of achilles on the white island leuce in the black sea off the modern coasts of romania and ukraine with a temple and an oracle which survived into the roman period.
 in the lost epic aithiopis a continuation of the iliad attributed to arktinus of miletos achilles mother thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to leuce at the mouths of the danube.
 there the achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.
 pliny s natural history mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident insula akchillis tumulo eius viri clara on the island consecrated to him located at a distance of fifty roman miles from peuce by the danube delta and the temple there.
 pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame.
 in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue .
 ruins of a square temple three zero meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in one eight two three but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.
 pomponius mela tells that achilles is buried in the island named achillea between boristhene and ister.
 the greek geographer dionysius periegetus of bithynia who lived at the time of domitian writes that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white.
 it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor .
 the periplus of the euxine sea gives the following details it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea for her son achilles who dwells there.
 here is his temple and his statue an archaic work.
 this island is not inhabited and goats graze on it not many which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships sacrifice to achilles.
 in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts craters rings and precious stones offered to achilles in gratitude.
 one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin in which achilles is praised and celebrated.
 some of these are worded in patroclus honor because those who wish to be favored by achilles honor patroclus at the same time.
 there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds which look after achilles temple.
 every morning they fly out to sea wet their wings with water and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it.
 and after they finish the sprinkling they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings.
 other people say still more that some of the men who reach this island come here intentionally.
 they bring animals in their ships destined to be sacrificed.
 some of these animals they slaughter others they set free on the island in achilles honor.
 but there are others who are forced to come to this island by sea storms.
 as they have no sacrificial animals but wish to get them from the god of the island himself they consult achilles oracle.
 they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair.
 but in case the oracle denies them permission because there is an oracle here they add something to the price offered and if the oracle refuses again they add something more until at last the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient.
 and then the victim doesn t run away any more but waits willingly to be caught.
 so there is a great quantity of silver there consecrated to the hero as price for the sacrificial victims.
 to some of the people who come to this island achilles appears in dreams to others he would appear even during their navigation if they were not too far away and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships .
 quoted in densu ianu the heroic cult of achilles on leuce island was widespread in antiquity not only along the sea lanes of the pontic sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the black sea.
 achilles from leuce island was venerated as pontarches the lord and master of the pontic sea the protector of sailors and navigation.
 sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice.
 to achilles of leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters achilleion in messenia stephanus byzantinus achilleios in laconia pausanias iii.
 two five four nicolae densu ianu densu ianu one nine one three even though he recognized achilles in the name of aquileia and in the north arm of the danube delta the arm of chilia achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over pontos evokes modern rather than archaic sea law.
 leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing.
 pausanias iii.
 one nine one three reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound.
 ammianus marcellinus xxii.
 eight attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island.
 worship of achilles in modern times the achilleion in corfu in the region of gastouri to the south of the city of corfu greece empress of austria elisabeth of bavaria also known as sissi built in one eight nine zero a summer palace with achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism .
 the palace naturally was named after achilles achilleion .
 this elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the trojan war .
 other stories achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the achilleion in corfu.

 achilles some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hides the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros .
 there achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl .
 with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers a son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s possible alias .
 according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid.
 odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.
 when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign.
 in another version of the story odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away.
 in book one one of homer s odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades.
 one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead.
 but achilles then asks odysseus of his son s exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction.
 this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life.
 achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea the location of the mythical white island which he was said to inhabit after his death together with many other heroes.
 the kings of the epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus.
 alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor.
 he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy.
 in ad two one six the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus.
 achilles fought and killed the amazon helene .
 some also said he married medea and that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica .
 in some versions of the myth achilles has a relationship with his captive briseis .
 achilles in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars.
 the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel.
 extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.
 the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today.
 in plato s symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.
 the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character.
 only a few fragments survive.
 towards the end of the five th century bc a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis .
 achilles in greek philosophy the philosopher zeno of elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible.
 as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.
 achilles in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles.
 vergil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.
 other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career.
 this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in beno t de sainte maure s roman de troie and guido delle colonne s historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the one seven th century.

 on april one two one eight six one confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war.
 historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion.
 william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war.
 donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft.
 sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood.
 but he also vowed not to surrender the forts.
 the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that.
 on april one five lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling seven five zero zero zero troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.
 this call forced the states to choose sides.

 lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander in chief using unprecedented powers.
 he expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers.
 lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions.

 the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention.
 from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army.
 copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue.
 conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.
 on august six one eight six one lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort.
 in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy.

 he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martial ed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed.
 fr mont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption.
 lincoln overruled fr mont s proclamation.

 lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with britain.
 lincoln s foreign policy approach had been initially hands off due to his inexperience he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his secretary of state william seward.
 seward s initial reaction to the trent affair however was too bellicose so lincoln also turned to senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and an expert in british diplomacy.

 stanton was a staunchly unionist pro business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction.
 nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official.
 stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman.
 in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that washington was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory major northern newspaper editors expected victory within nine zero days.
 twice a week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.
 lincoln learned from his chief of staff general henry halleck a student of the european strategist jomini of the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river he also knew well the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing territory.

 mcclellan general in chief of all the union armies.
 mcclellan a young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted.
 the campaign s objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital.
 mcclellan s repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington.
 lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops in defense of the capital mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.
 alt photograph of lincoln and mcclellan sitting at a table in a field tent lincoln and george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in one eight six two .
 lincoln removed mcclellan as general in chief and appointed henry wager halleck in march one eight six two after mcclellan s harrison s landing letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort.
 mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia .
 pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack.
 however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of one eight six two forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time.
 the war also expanded with naval operations in one eight six two when the css virginia formerly the uss merrimack damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor .
 lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads .
 despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan s failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward.
 two days after mcclellan s return to command general robert e.
 lee s forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september one eight six two .
 the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january.
 having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.
 mcclellan then resisted the president s demand that he pursue lee s retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee.
 as a result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the one eight six two midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside .
 both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander in chief.

 burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december.
 not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined.
 desertions during one eight six three were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg.
 lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.
 the mid term elections in one eight six two brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market.
 the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest.
 while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york.
 the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york.
 the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress .
 in the spring of one eight six three lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together these plans included hooker s attack on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant s on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston.
 hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may but continued to command his troops for some weeks.
 he ignored lincoln s order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harper s ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted.
 he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was a victory for the union though lee s army avoided capture.
 at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor.
 after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general in chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans.
 even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander in chief.

 lincoln understood that the federal government s power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before one eight six five committed the issue to individual states.
 he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new u.
s.
 territory.
 at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery.
 lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution.

 fr mont in august one eight six one and by major general david hunter in may one eight six two on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union.
 on june one nine one eight six two endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory.
 in july the confiscation act of one eight six two was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion.
 although lincoln believed it was not within congress s power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature.
 he felt such action could only be taken by the commander in chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action.
 in that month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet.
 in it he stated that as a fit and necessary military measure on january one one eight six three all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free .
 privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated.
 however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification.
 republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august two two one eight six two .
 although he said he personally wished all men could be free lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the u.
s.
 president he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty was that of preserving the union the emancipation proclamation issued on september two two one eight six two and put into effect on january one one eight six three declared free the slaves in one zero states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states.
 lincoln spent the next one zero zero days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the one eight six two off year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.
 once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed.
 lincoln s comment on the signing of the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper.
 for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves.
 he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.
 a few days after emancipation was announced one three republican governors met at the war governors conference they supported the president s proclamation but suggested the removal of general george b.
 mcclellan as commander of the union army.
 enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation.
 by the spring of one eight six three lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers.
 in a letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of five zero zero zero zero armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once .
 by the end of one eight six three at lincoln s direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited two zero regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley.
 frederick douglass once observed of lincoln in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color .
 gettysburg address one eight six three the only confirmed photo of abraham lincoln at gettysburg some three hours before the speech .
 with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july one eight six three and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots .
 the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november one nine one eight six three .
 defying lincoln s prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history.
 in two seven two words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in one seven eight nine but in one seven seven six conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
 he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all.
 the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort.
 he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth .
 lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation.
 general grant alt painting of four men conferring in a ship s cabin entitled the peacemakers .
 president lincoln center right with from left generals sherman and grant and admiral porter one eight six eight painting of events aboard the river queen in march one eight six five meade s failure to capture lee s army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed.
 general ulysses s.
 grant s victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army.
 responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i can t spare this man.
 he fights.
 with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.
 nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in one eight six four as mcclellan was.
 lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant s political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grant s promotion to commander of the union army.
 he obtained congress s consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington.
 grant waged his bloody overland campaign in one eight six four .
 this is often characterized as a war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor .
 even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces .
 the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north grant had lost a third of his army and lincoln asked what grant s plans were to which the general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.
 the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lee s army shrank with every costly battle.
 grant s army moved south crossed the james river forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia .
 lincoln then made an extended visit to grant s headquarters at city point virginia.
 this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina.
 lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced the union losses.
 lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure such as plantations railroads and bridges hoping to destroy the south s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting.
 grant s move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south.
 this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia s shenandoah valley .
 the damage caused by sherman s march to the sea through georgia in one eight six four was limited to a swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies.

 during early s raid on washington d.
c.
 in one eight six four lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched.
 as grant continued to wear down lee s forces efforts to discuss peace began.
 confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads .
 lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.
 on april one one eight six five grant successfully outflanked lee s forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond.
 days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital as he walked through the city white southerners were stone faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero.
 on april nine lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over.
 one eight six four re election while the war was still being waged lincoln faced reelection in one eight six four .
 lincoln was a master politician bringing together and holding together all the main factions of the republican party and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m.
 stanton and andrew johnson as well.
 lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers greatly expanded over peacetime to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the one eight six four ticket.
 at its one eight six four convention the republican party selected johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate.
 to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party .
 when grant s one eight six four spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the president s re election prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated.
 sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
 while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b.
 mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform.
 lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort.
 sherman s capture of atlanta in september and david farragut s capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln.
 by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads.
 on november eight lincoln was re elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving seven eight percent of the union soldiers vote.
 on march four one eight six five lincoln delivered his second inaugural address .
 in it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god s will.
 historian mark noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world .
 lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves.
 shortly after lee s surrender a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied let em up easy.
 in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep.
 thaddeus stevens sen.
 charles sumner and sen.
 benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues.
 determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war.
 his amnesty proclamation of december eight one eight six three offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance.
 alt cartoon of lincoln and johnson attempting to stitch up the broken union a political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson a former tailor and lincoln one eight six five entitled the rail splitter at work repairing the union.
 the caption reads johnson take it quietly uncle abe and i will draw it closer than ever.
 lincoln a few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended.
 as southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed.
 of special importance were tennessee and arkansas where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors respectively.
 in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p.
 banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when one zero percent of the voters agreed to it.
 lincoln s democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations.
 on the other hand the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill in one eight six four .
 when lincoln vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee.
 lincoln s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness.
 to fill chief justice taney s seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon p.
 chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.
 after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment.
 lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter .
 by december one eight six three a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage.
 this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two thirds majority on june one five one eight six four in the house of representatives.
 passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican unionist platform in the election of one eight six four .
 after a long debate in the house a second attempt passed congress on january three one one eight six five and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.
 upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december six one eight six five .
 as the war drew to a close lincoln s presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen.
 he signed into law senator charles sumner s freedmen s bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves.
 the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen.
 lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction.
 shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction.
 discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists.
 historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen.
 lincoln biographers james g.
 randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that it is likely that had he lived lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson s that he would have clashed with congressional radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson s mistakes.
 eric foner argues that unlike sumner and other radicals lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation.
 he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land.
 he believed as most republicans did in april one eight six five that the voting requirements should be determined by the states.
 he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists reluctant secessionists and forward looking former confederates.
 but time and again during the war lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans.
 .
.
.
 lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves .
.
.
 it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death.
 redefining the republic and republicanism upright alt an older tired looking abraham lincoln with a beard.
 lincoln in february one eight six five about two months before his death.
 the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country.
 the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency.
 the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the one nine th century.
 in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln s redefinition of republican values .
 as early as the one eight five zero s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism.
 the declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitution s tolerance of slavery shifted the debate.
 as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early one eight six zero lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.
 his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms.
 nevertheless in one eight six one lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.
 burton two zero zero eight argues that lincoln s republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated.
 in march one eight six one in lincoln s first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy.
 he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system.
 he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people.
 other enactments lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them.
 lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress the only important one was the wade davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction.
 he signed the homestead act in one eight six two making millions of acres of government held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost.
 the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in one eight six two provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state.
 the pacific railway acts of one eight six two and one eight six four granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in one eight six nine .
 the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the one eight five zero s.
 other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a new federal income tax.
 in one eight six one lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first having become law under james buchanan.
 also in one eight six one lincoln signed the revenue act of one eight six one creating the first u.
s.
 income tax.
 this created a flat tax of three percent on incomes above eight zero zero in current dollar terms which was later changed by the revenue act of one eight six two to a progressive rate structure.
 lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government s economic influence in several other areas.
 the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country.
 it also established a national currency.
 in one eight six two congress created with lincoln s approval the department of agriculture .
 in one eight six two lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota.
 presented with three zero three execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving three nine for execution one was later reprieved .
 president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy.
 in the wake of grant s casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued.
 in response to rumors of one however the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market.
 lincoln s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers.
 the seizure lasted for two days.
 lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states.
 before lincoln s presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the one seven th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates.
 the last such proclamation had been during james madison s presidency five zero years before.
 in one eight six three lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving.
 in june one eight six four lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park .
 judicial appointments supreme court appointments noah haynes swayne one eight six two samuel freeman miller one eight six two david davis one eight six two stephen johnson field one eight six three salmon portland chase one eight six four chief justice salmon portland chase was lincoln s choice to be chief justice of the united states .
 lincoln s declared philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it.
 therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.
 lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court.
 noah haynes swayne nominated january two one one eight six two and appointed january two four one eight six two was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union.
 samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july one six one eight six two supported lincoln in the one eight six zero election and was an avowed abolitionist.
 david davis lincoln s campaign manager in one eight six zero nominated december one one eight six two and appointed december eight one eight six two had also served as a judge in lincoln s illinois court circuit.
 stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice was nominated march six one eight six three and appointed march one zero one eight six three and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a democrat.
 finally lincoln s treasury secretary salmon p.
 chase was nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december six one eight six four .
 lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party.
 other judicial appointments lincoln appointed three two federal judges including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states and two seven judges to the united states district courts .
 lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit court s during his time in office.
 states admitted to the union west virginia admitted to the union june two zero one eight six three contained the former north westernmost counties of virginia that seceded from virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the union.
 as a condition for its admission west virginia s constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery.

 assassination and funeral alt image of lincoln being shot by booth while sitting in a theater booth.
 shown in the presidential booth of ford s theatre from left to right are assassin john wilkes booth abraham lincoln mary todd lincoln clara harris and henry rathbone .
 john wilkes booth was a well known actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service.
 in one eight six four booth formulated a plan very similar to one of thomas n.
 conrad previously authorized by the confederacy to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners.
 after attending an april one one one eight six five speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.
 learning that the president and grant would be attending ford s theatre booth formulated a plan with co conspirators to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater as well as vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their homes.
 without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april one four .
 at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.
 lincoln s bodyguard john parker left ford s theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door.
 the now unguarded president sat in his state box in the balcony.
 seizing the opportunity booth crept up from behind and at about one zero one three pm aimed at the back of lincoln s head and fired at point blank range mortally wounding the president.
 major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped.
 after being on the run for one two days booth was tracked down and found on a farm in virginia some south of washington.
 after refusing to surrender to union troops booth was killed by sergeant boston corbett on april two six .

 poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom d to eulogize lincoln one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president.
 historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but also noted that some lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news.
 african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses .
 in a larger sense the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.
 religious and philosophical beliefs upright alt a painting of lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg.
 lincoln painting by george peter alexander healy in one eight six nine as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic or in the words of a biographer an iconoclast .
 later in life lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants.
 he never joined a church although he frequently attended with his wife.
 however he was deeply familiar with the bible and he both quoted and praised it.
 he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others.
 lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs.
 however he did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by one eight six five was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.
 in the one eight four zero s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.
 in the one eight five zero s lincoln believed in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence.
 when he suffered the death of his son edward lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god.
 the death of his son willie in february one eight six two may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace.
 after willie s death lincoln considered why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary.
 he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest.
 yet the contest began.
 and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day.
 yet the contest proceeds.
 on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land .
 health several claims abound that lincoln s health was declining before the assassination.
 these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting.
 one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder men two b which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma mucosal neuromas and a marfinoid appearance .
 others simply claim he had marfan s syndrome based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers and the association of possible aortic regurgitation which can cause bobbing of the head demusset s sign based on blurring of lincoln s head in photographs which back then had a long exposure time.

 president lincoln s assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr.
 lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty.
 republicans linked lincoln s name to their party.
 many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.
 schwartz argues that lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late one nine th century until the progressive era one nine zero zero one nine two zero s when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history with even white southerners in agreement.
 the high point came in one nine two two with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the mall in washington.
 in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state.
 in the cold war years lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.
 by the one nine seven zero s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers.
 as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats .
 william c.
 harris found that lincoln s reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism .
 james g.
 randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform .
 randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.
 by the late one nine six zero s liberals such as historian lerone bennett were having second thoughts especially regarding lincoln s views on racial issues.
 bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in one nine six eight .
 he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs told jokes that ridiculed blacks insisted he opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country.
 defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible.
 the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.
 historian barry schwartz wrote in two zero zero nine that lincoln s image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late two zero th century.
 on the other hand donald opined in his one nine nine six biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason .
 today s u.

 president however seems to be promoting a sympathetic resurgence for his predecessor lincoln.
 indeed president obama has insisted on using lincoln s bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations.
 lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light.

 lincoln s portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the five bill .
 his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska.
 the most famous and most visited memorials are the lincoln memorial in washington d.

 lincoln s sculpture on mount rushmore ford s theatre and petersen house where he died in washington and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum located in springfield illinois not far from lincoln s home and his tomb .
 there was also the great moments with mr.
 lincoln exhibit in disneyland and the hall of presidents at walt disney world which had to do with walt disney admiring lincoln ever since he was a little boy.
 barry schwartz a sociologist who has examined america s cultural memory argues that in the one nine three zero s and one nine four zero s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life .
 during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the world s disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful .
 franklin d.
 roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan.
 americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness .
 he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

 his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his guardian.
 at eighteen he joined plato s academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven c.
 three four seven bc .
 his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric linguistics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy .
 shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip of macedon tutored alexander the great starting from three four three bc.
 according to the encyclop dia britannica aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history .
.
.
 and every scientist is in his debt.
 teaching alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies.
 he established a library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books.
 the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following plato s death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism .
 he believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception .
 aristotle s views on natural science s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.
 aristotle s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship.
 their influence extended into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics .
 some of aristotle s zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were not confirmed or refuted until the one nine th century.
 his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late one nine th century into modern formal logic .
 in metaphysics aristotelianism profoundly influenced judeo islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology especially the scholastic tradition of the catholic church .
 aristotle was well known among medieval muslim intellectuals and revered as the first teacher .
 his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics .
 all aspects of aristotle s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.
 though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues cicero described his literary style as a river of gold it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.
 life school of aristotle in mieza macedonia greece aristotle whose name means the best purpose was born in three eight four bc in stagira chalcidice about five five km three four miles east of modern day thessaloniki .
 his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon .
 although there is little information on aristotle s childhood he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy.
 at about the age of eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato s academy .
 he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in three four eight four seven bc.
 the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy s direction after control passed to plato s nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared anti macedonian sentiments and left before plato died.
 aristotle by francesco hayez one seven nine one one eight eight two aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor .
 there he traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island.
 aristotle married pythias either hermias s adoptive daughter or niece.
 she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias.
 soon after hermias death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in three four three bc.
 aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon .
 during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander .
 aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric .
 in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants .
 by three three five bc artistotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum .
 aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years.
 while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus .
 according to the suda he also had an eromenos palaephatus of abydus .
 this period in athens between three three five and three two three bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.
 he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived.
 those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students.
 his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics .
 aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them.
 in physical science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology.
 in philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology.
 he also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry.
 his combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge.
 near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander s relationship with persia and persians.
 a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander s death but there is little evidence.
 following alexander s death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled.
 in three two two bc eurymedon the hierophant denounced aristotle for not holding the gods in honor prompting him to flee to his mother s family estate in chalcis explaining i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athens s prior trial and execution of socrates .
 he died in euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.
 charles walston argues that the tomb of aristotle is located on the sacred way between chalcis and eretria and to have contained two styluses a pen a signet ring and some terra cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of aristotle in the form of some skull fragments.
 in general the details of the life of aristotle are not well established.
 the biographies of aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.
 thought logic upright aristotle portrayed in the one four nine three nuremberg chronicle as a scholar of the one five th century ad.
 with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until one nine th century advances in mathematical logic .
 kant stated in the critique of pure reason that aristotle s theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference .
 history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of .
 however plato reports that syntax was devised before him by prodicus of ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words.
 logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications.
 even plato had difficulties with logic although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic .
 plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premise s hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow.
 consequently plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial.
 he never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method.
 analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labeled analytics .
 the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics .
 most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers.
 the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early one st century ce categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings.
 it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations .
 the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning.
 there is one volume of aristotle s concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics.
 aristotle s epistemology plato left and aristotle right a detail of the school of athens a fresco by raphael .
 aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding a copy of his nicomachean ethics in his hand whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in the forms while holding a copy of timaeus like his teacher plato aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal .
 aristotle s ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in plato s ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or .
 for aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.
 for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in a particular substance see universals and particulars below .
 in a certain sense aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while plato s is essentially deductive from a priori principles.
 in aristotle s terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences.
 in modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role.
 today s philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method.
 in contrast aristotle s philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.
 in the larger sense of the word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science .
 note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method .
 for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics one zero two five b two five .
 by practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics.
 if logic or analytics is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of one logic two theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics and mathematics three practical philosophy and four poetical philosophy.
 in the period between his two stays in athens between his times at the academy and the lyceum aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today.
 in fact most of aristotle s life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science.
 aristotle s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics.
 he did however perform original research in the natural sciences e.
g.
 botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences.
 aristotle s writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative.
 beginning in the one six th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and aristotle s work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate.
 his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature.
 he had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers.
 his writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors.
 for example in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.
 in a similar vein john philoponus and later galileo showed by simple experiments that aristotle s theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.
 on the other hand aristotle refuted democritus s claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun s rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then .
.
.
 the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.
 in places aristotle goes too far in deriving laws of the universe from simple observation and over stretched reason .
 today s scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective and that discerning the validity of one s hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which aristotle used to support his laws.
 aristotle also had some scientific blind spots.
 he posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the one six th century.
 from the three rd century to the one six th century the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe .
 because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance these thinkers often took aristotle s erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch.
 however aristotle s scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields.
 for instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia.
 moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.
 geology as quoted from principles of geology he aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages.
 he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized.
 he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time .
.
.
 he alludes .
.
.
 to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption.
 the changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten.
 he says one two th chapter of his meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period.
 the concluding observation is as follows as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed for ever.
 the places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time.
 so also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time.
 physics five elements aristotle proposed a fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles .
 earth which is cold and dry this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.
 water which is cold and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.
 air which is hot and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.
 fire which is hot and dry this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat.
 aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies stars and planets .
 each of the four earthly elements has its natural place.
 all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe i.
e.
 the center of the earth.
 water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center.
 air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere.
 fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the moon orbits .
 when elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it.
 this is natural motion motion requiring no extrinsic cause.
 so for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises.
 outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles.
 motion aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as such .
 aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state.
 because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it.
 causality the four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors material cause describes the material out of which something is composed.
 thus the material cause of a table is wood and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel.
 it is not about action.
 it does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.
 the formal cause is its form i.
e.
 the arrangement of that matter.
 it tells us what a thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype.
 it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole i.
e.
 macrostructure is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the whole part causation.
 plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter.
 formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation.
 a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create his drawings.
 the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds.
 it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest.
 representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.
 so take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.
 the final cause is its purpose or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities.
 the final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve.
 this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs.
 additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal.
 thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect .
 moreover aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes.
 simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event.
 our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord.
 aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation.
 all causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic.
 the same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects.
 essentially causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.
 optics aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day.
 the second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura after mozi c.
 four zero zero bc can be found in aristotle s documentation of such a device in three five zero bc in problemata .
 aristotle s apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter.
 aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object.
 in modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm .
 aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified.
 chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause.
 chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things .
 it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance .
 for a better understanding of aristotle s conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place.
 for example a person seeks donations.
 that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum.
 however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance.
 it must be unusual that something happens by chance.
 in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance.
 there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions.
 according to aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice.
 what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance .
 metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction .
 he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science.
 substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form.
 in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed.
 for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc.
 or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as a house.
 the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.
 with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption three one nine b three two zero a he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality.
 the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property.
 in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form.
 referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else.
 for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant.
 potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned.
 for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting .
 actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality.
 because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end.
 referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
 for that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired.
 for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see.
 in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end.
 then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality.
 with this definition of the particular substance i.
e.
 matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing.
 universals and particulars aristotle s predecessor plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things.
 when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple.
 in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple.
 moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.
 plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things.
 for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form.
 bertrand russell is a two zero th century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals .
 aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated.
 aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things.
 according to aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated.
 consequently according to aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist.
 in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals.
 as plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated.
 so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms.
 biology and medicine in aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition.
 he dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.
 empirical research program octopus swimming torpedo fuscomaculata leopard shark aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail.
 aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas.
 the works that reflect this research such as history of animals generation of animals and parts of animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes.
 the most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen.
 his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopod s namely octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo .
 his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the one nine th century.
 he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selach selachians .
 another good example of his methods comes from the generation of animals in which aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.
 he gave accurate descriptions of ruminant s four chambered fore stomachs and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus .
 classification of living things aristotle distinguished about five zero zero species of birds mammals and fishes.
 his classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the one nine th century.
 what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin but of a different kind from vertebrates .
 animals with blood were divided into live bearing mammals and egg bearing birds and fish .
 invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled cephalopods and shelled and testacea molluscs .
 in some respects this incomplete classification is better than that of linnaeus who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups insecta and vermes worms .
 for charles singer nothing is more remarkable than aristotle s efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a scala naturae aristotle s history of animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical ladder of life scala naturae or great chain of being placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.
 aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i.
e.
 final cause s guided all natural processes.
 such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design.
 noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a single hooved animal with two horns i have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary.
 noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve a type of balance.
 in a similar fashion aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man the scala naturae .
 his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth.
 the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs.
 aristotle also held that the level of a creature s perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form.
 ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times.
 he placed emphasis on the type s of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection.
 aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain.
 notable is aristotle s division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon .
 successor theophrastus the frontispiece to a one six four four version of the expanded and illustrated edition of historia plantarum ca.
 one two zero zero which was originally written around three zero zero bc.
 aristotle s successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany the history of plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages .
 many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel.
 rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotle s concept of the efficient cause .
 theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages.
 influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work.
 though interest in aristotle s ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly.
 it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.
 the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation.
 herophilus also distinguished between vein s and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.
 though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the one eight th and one nine th centuries.
 ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance.
 aristotle s ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly.
 psychology aristotle s psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul.
 humans have a rational soul.
 this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally.
 the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.
 for aristotle the soul psyche was a simpler concept than it is for us today.
 by soul he simply meant the form of a living being.
 because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e.
g.
 the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement .
 memory according to aristotle memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past.
 in other words a memory is a mental picture in which aristotle defines in de anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory.
 aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory.
 a memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system semi fluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once.
 these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking .
 the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception.
 it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as a mental image in memory aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities.
 first the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic imprint that can develop from sensation.
 second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents.
 these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time.
 therefore memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present.
 the retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly.
 a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience.
 aristotle proposed that slow witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue.
 however they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints .
 he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint .
 young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderly s organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints .
 likewise people who are too quick witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ.
 because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time.
 recollection because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience.
 in order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself.
 within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for.
 recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another.
 if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other.
 if the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances.
 when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.
 recollection is the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory imprint after some time has passed.
 retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses .
 only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words.
 animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations.
 remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.
 recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences.
 when an imprint is recalled it may bring forth a large group of related imprints .
 aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity.
 these three laws make up his laws of association .
 aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind.
 a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience.
 according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled.
 dreams sleep before understanding aristotle s take on dreams first his idea of sleep must be examined.
 aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in on sleep and wakefulness .
 sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body including the senses so it can be revitalized.
 while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness.
 since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire which is the result of a sensation.
 however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences.
 also all of the senses are not inactive during sleep only the ones that are weary.
 theory of dreams dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because as discussed the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep.
 in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner than when awake.
 aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water.
 when they look away from that stimulus the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion.
 when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression.
 when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant.
 however during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made.
 so dreams result from these lasting impressions.
 since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.
 during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind.
 aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus.
 for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings.
 when a person is asleep their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings.
 since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.
 when asleep a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream.
 this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real.
 dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not.
 so the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.
 one component of aristotle s theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs.
 he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being.
 aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations.
 these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.
 aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not.
 he claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it.
 if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred.
 secondly any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream.
 for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream.
 the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream.
 lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.
 practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i.
e.
 one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake.
 he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics .
 aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing.
 an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight.
 aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos .
 aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being .
 to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character thik aret often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence .
 aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things.
 when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher.
 politics aristotle s classification of constitution s in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics .
 aristotle considered the city to be a natural community.
 moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part .
 he also famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and also arguing that humanity s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality .
 aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others.
 aristotle s conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.
 the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle s understanding.
 although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koin nia .
 the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together .
 this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences.
 excerpt from a speech by the character aristotle in the book protrepticus hutchinson and johnson two zero one five p.
 two two for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule i.
e.
 the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative but the law is a kind of intelligence i.
e.
 a discourse based on intelligence.
 and again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man for all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad.
 and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions a just man choosing to live justly a man with bravery to live bravely likewise a self controlled man to live with self control it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent for this is the function of that capacity.
 hence it s evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods.
 rhetoric and poetics aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner.
 for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language.
 the forms also differ in their object of imitation.
 comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average.
 lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama.
 aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind s advantages over animals.
 while it is believed that aristotle s poetics comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived.
 aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry.
 the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy.
 tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions.
 aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis .
 he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic.
 aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop .
 views on women aristotle s analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element.
 on this ground feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism .
 however aristotle gave equal weight to women s happiness as he did to men s and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.
 loss and preservation of his works first page of a one five six six edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin modern scholarship reveals that aristotle s lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus.
 whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so.
 rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication.
 the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle s at all.
 some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle s school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision.
 others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotle s successors at the lyceum e.
g.
 theophrastus and straton .
 still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus .
 other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional.
 according to a distinction that originates with aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric .
 most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course school esoteric .
 modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle s own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students .
 however one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.
 the five th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle s writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these.
 another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant that all of aristotle s extant writings are of the esoteric kind.
 current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form.
 fragments of some of aristotle s dialogues have survived.
 perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle s writing style as a river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.
 however some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that cicero s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle s extant works.
 one major question in the history of aristotle s works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives .
 the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis .
 neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the one st century bc when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to athens.
 according to the story apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing a number of errors into the text.
 when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in eight six bc he carried off the library of apellicon to rome where they were first published in six zero bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes .
 carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century b.
c.
 lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story however.
 first the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon s inexpert attempt at repair.
 second there is incontrovertible evidence lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis.
 third the definitive edition of aristotle s texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his.
 and fourth ancient library catalogues predating andronicus intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess.
 lord sees a number of post aristotelian interpolations in the politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.
 on the one hand the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within aristotle s school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime.
 the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today.

 statue by cipri adolf bermann one nine one five at the university of freiburg freiburg im breisgau more than two three zero zero years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived.
 he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields.
 according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did .
 among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.
 despite these achievements the influence of aristotle s errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably.
 bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine .
 russell also refers to aristotle s ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy .
 russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.
 later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle s work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school .
 aristotle s notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion meno mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus .
 aristotle s influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers.
 he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher.
 although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle s geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men s common property influence on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus.
 the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century.
 john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle s views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought.
 after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena .
 influence on islamic theologians aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology .
 most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars.
 averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers.
 alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers.
 medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher .
 the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy .
 in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher the author of a closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought.
 some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo platonic metaphysical ideas.

 in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke .
 after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbeke s translations the demand for aristotle s writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance .
 aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas .
 see summa theologica part i question three etc.
 these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages.
 it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.

 however debatable this is aristotle rigid separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others.
 it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.
 ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking.
 more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans.
 list of works the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum.

 inspired by the time gershwin had spent in paris it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the one nine two zero s and is one of his best known compositions.
 gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the conductor walter damrosch .
 he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophone s and automobile horns.
 he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december one three one nine two eight in carnegie hall with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic .
 gershwin completed the orchestration on november one eight less than four weeks before the work s premiere.
 gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor noting that my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere.

 but nostalgia is not a fatal disease.
 the american visitor once again is an alert spectator of parisian life and the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant.
 background gershwin was attracted by maurice ravel s unusual chords.
 after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether ravel took students and how much he charged ravel looked at gershwin s prior year earnings and sent a telegram to gershwin jokingly saying he ravel should study with gershwin .
.
.
but he accepted him as a student.
 gershwin went to paris in one nine two six ready to study and to enjoy his first trip to paris.
 after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he couldn t teach him but he would send a letter referring him to nadia boulanger .
 while the studies were cut short that one nine two six trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a thank you note to gershwin s hosts robert and mabel shirmer.
 gershwin called it a rapsodic ballet written so freely and much more modern than his prior works.
 gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour something ravel had been reluctant to do.
 to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravel s friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the u.

 schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel a one two zero zero zero fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel.
 gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february one nine two eight at the start of ravel s u.
s.
 tour and joined ravel again later in the tour in los angeles.
 after a lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled house concert in a friend s music salon performing among kindred spirits.
 ravel s tour reignited gershwin s desire to return to paris which he did in march one nine two eight .
 ravel s high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris.
 yet after playing for her she told him she could not teach him.
 nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students don t copy others be yourself.
 in this case why try to be a second rate ravel when you are already a first rate gershwin this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue .
 paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w.
 b.
 yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso .
 composition gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in one nine two six on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer.
 he described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works.
 gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere.
 the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format .
 gershwin s first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio .
 the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six .
 this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns.
 the b section s andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness.
 the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues .
 in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum.
 moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a.
 after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso.
 instrumentation an american in paris is scored for three flute s three rd doubling on piccolo two oboe s english horn two clarinet s in b flat bass clarinet in b flat two bassoon s four horn s in f three trumpet s in b flat three trombone s tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbal s low and high tom tom s xylophone glockenspiel celesta four taxi horns labeled as a b c and d alto saxophone soprano saxophone tenor saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone baritone saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone and strings .
 the revised edition by f.
 campbell watson calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone.
 in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.
 william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in one nine two nine .
 response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris .
 he stated that damrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work.
 the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses.
 critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f .
 some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers c sar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere.
 gershwin responded to the critics it s not a beethoven symphony you know.
.
.
 it s a humorous piece nothing solemn about it.
 it s not intended to draw tears.
 if it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds.
 preservation status on september two two two zero one three it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released.
 the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin s true intent.
 it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster one two bar blues section or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin s composition process.
 the score to an american in paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released.
 the entire project may take three zero to four zero years to complete but an american in paris will be an early volume in the series.
 two urtext editions of the work have been published by the german publisher b note music in two zero one five .
 the changes made by campbell watson have been withdrawn in both editions.
 in the extended urtext one two zero bars of music have been re integrated.
 conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.
 recordings first recording an american in paris has been frequently recorded.
 the first recording was made for rca victor in one nine two nine with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra .
 gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.
 then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.
 the radio broadcast of the september eight one nine three seven hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in one nine nine eight in a two cd set.
 arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.
 in one nine four five arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the music in carnegie hall one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer.
 the seattle symphony also recorded a version in one nine nine zero of gershwin s original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.
 use in film in one nine five one mgm released the musical an american in paris featuring gene kelly and leslie caron .
 winning the one nine five one best picture oscar and numerous other awards the film was directed by vincente minnelli featured many tunes of gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem arranged for the film by johnny green costing five zero zero zero zero zero .

 the academy award for best production design recognizes achievement in art direction on a film.
 the category s original name was best art direction but was changed to its current name in two zero one two for the eight five th academy awards.
 this change resulted from the art director s branch of the academy being renamed the designer s branch.

 the various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette officially called the academy award of merit which has become commonly known by its nickname oscar .
 the awards first presented in one nine two nine at the hollywood roosevelt hotel are overseen by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas .
 the awards ceremony was first televised in one nine five three and is now seen live in more than two zero zero countries.
 the oscars is the oldest entertainment awards ceremony its equivalents the emmy award s for television the tony award s for theatre and the grammy award s for music and recording are modeled after the academy awards.
 the eight six th academy awards ceremony was held on march two two zero one four at the dolby theatre in los angeles later than usual as to not clash with the winter olympics in sochi russia.
 the eight seven th academy awards ceremony was held on february two two two zero one five .
 historically given during the first quarter of the new year the awards honor achievements for cinematic accomplishments for the preceding year.
 for example one two years a slave was awarded best picture for two zero one three although the oscar ceremony was conducted in two zero one four .
 as of the eight seven th awards ceremony held in two zero one five a total of two nine four seven oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.
 history the first academy awards presentation was held on may one six one nine two nine at a private dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about two seven zero people.
 the post awards party was held at the mayfair hotel.
 the cost of guest tickets for that night s ceremony was five r zero in dollars .
 fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the one nine two seven two eight period.
 the ceremony ran for one five minutes.
 winners had been announced to media three months earlier however that was changed for the second ceremony in one nine three zero .
 since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at one one zero zero pm on the night of the awards.
 this method was used until an occasion when the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the academy has since one nine four one used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.
 the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh .
 he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history.
 at that time the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films.
 with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film.
 for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.
 at the two nine th ceremony held on march two seven one nine five seven the best foreign language film category was introduced.
 until then foreign language films had been honored with the special achievement award.
 the seven four th academy awards held in two zero zero two presented the first academy award for best animated feature.

 shumway one of the earliest mentions in print of the term oscar dates back to a time magazine article about the one nine three four six th academy awards .
 walt disney is also quoted as thanking the academy for his oscar as early as one nine three two .
 another claimed origin is that the academy s executive secretary margaret herrick first saw the award in one nine three one and made reference to the statuette s reminding her of her uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce .
 columnist sidney skolsky was present during herrick s naming and seized the name in his byline employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar .
 the trophy was officially dubbed the oscar in one nine three nine by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences.
 engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates.
 until two zero one zero winners were expected to return the statuettes to the academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied.
 since two zero one zero winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the governor s ball a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony.
 in two zero one zero the r.
s.
 owens company made one nine seven engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony bearing the names of every potential winner.
 the one seven five or so nameplates for non winning nominees were recycled afterwards.
 ownership of oscar statuettes since one nine five zero the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the academy for us one .
 if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette.
 academy awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums.
 in december two zero one one orson welles one nine four one oscar for citizen kane best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a two zero zero four court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy.
 on december two zero two zero one one it sold in an online auction for us eight six one five four two .
 in one nine nine two harold russell needed money for his wife s medical expenses.
 in a controversial decision he consigned his one nine four six oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to herman darvick autograph auctions and on august six one nine nine two in new york city the oscar sold to a private collector for six zero five zero zero .
 russell defended his action saying i don t know why anybody would be critical.
 my wife s health is much more important than sentimental reasons.
 the movie will be here even if oscar isn t.
 harold russell is the only academy award winning actor to ever sell an oscar.
 while the oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market.
 michael todd s grandson tried to sell todd s oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in one nine eight nine but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction.
 although some oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy which keeps them in its treasury.
 nomination since two zero zero four academy award nomination results have been announced to the public in late january.
 prior to that the results were announced in early february.
 voters the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of five seven eight three .
 academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production.
 actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering one three one one members two two percent of the academy s composition.
 votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and its predecessor price waterhouse for the past seven three annual awards ceremonies.
 all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors on behalf of academy branch executive committees.
 membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.
 new membership proposals are considered annually.
 the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as two zero zero seven press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join.
 the two zero zero seven release also stated that it has just under six zero zero zero voting members.
 while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.
 in two zero one two the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately eight eight of ampas voting membership.
 of the five one zero zero active voters confirmed nine four were caucasian seven seven were male and five four were found to be over the age of six zero .
 three three of voting members are former nominees one four and winners one nine .
 in may two zero one one the academy sent a letter advising its six zero zero zero or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting will be implemented in two zero one three .
 rules according to rules two and three of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of one january to midnight at the end of three one december in los angeles county california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the best foreign language film .
 for example the two zero zero nine best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in two zero zero eight but did not qualify for the two zero zero eight awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid two zero zero nine thus qualifying for the two zero zero nine awards .
 rule two states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of four zero minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a three five mm or seven zero mm film print or in two four frame s or four eight frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of two zero four eight by one zero eight zero pixels.
 producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year.
 the form includes the production credits for all related categories.
 then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases.
 in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around six zero zero zero active members.
 for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories i.
e.
 only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc.
 .
 in all major categories voters use an instant run off voting ballot with potential nominees rewarded in the single transferable vote tally for having strong supporters who rank them first.
 there are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like foreign film documentary and animated feature film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.
 in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category.
 foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year.
 the winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including best picture.
 film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season .
 the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified.
 it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.
 for example a producer of the two zero one zero best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as front runner the hurt locker eventually won .
 ceremony telecast three one st academy awards presentations pantages theatre hollywood one nine five nine eight one st academy awards presentations dolby theatre hollywood two zero zero nine the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees.
 it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year.
 this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day.
 black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this.
 the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast .
 the academy awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all united states time zones excluding hawaii they aired live in alaska starting in two zero one one for the first time since one nine nine six canada the united kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.
 the two zero zero seven ceremony was watched by more than four zero million americans.
 other awards ceremonies such as the emmys golden globes and grammys are broadcast live in the eastern the latter two countries did not broadcast the live show and mexico did not carry the live event until one nine six four .
 by one nine five four seven other countries namely brazil cuba venezuela west germany belgium the netherlands and france were already broadcasting the awards show although previously filmed into a condensed six zero minute version called the international edition of the academy awards.
 the awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in one nine seven zero but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the live event.
 by that time the television rights to the awards show were sold in five zero countries.
 a decade later the tv rights to the oscars were already being sold to six zero countries and by one nine eight four the tv rights to the awards were licensed in seven six countries.
 until the arrival of subscription television in europe africa and the middle east which enabled the oscars to be broadcast live through these territories there was already available a previously filmed or taped nine zero minute version of the awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories.
 however several asian and australasian countries such as japan hong kong south korea singapore malaysia australia and new zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the awards show since the late one nine seven zero s.
 ampas still produces a condensed nine zero minute version of the academy awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive.
 after more than six zero years of being held in late march or early april the ceremonies were moved up to late february or early march starting in two zero zero four to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry.
 another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the ncaa men s division i basketball championship which would cut into the academy awards audience.
 the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period.
 some years the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the winter olympics .
 another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.
 advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.
 the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most emmys in history with four seven wins and one nine five nominations.
 after many years of being held on mondays at nine zero zero pm eastern six zero zero p.
m pacific in one nine nine nine the ceremonies were moved to sundays at eight three zero pm eastern five three zero pm pacific.
 the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier.
 for many years the film industry had opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.
 originally scheduled for april eight one nine six eight the four zero th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr.
 martin luther king jr.
 .
 on march three zero one nine eight one the five three rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington d.
c.
 in one nine nine three an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding one two months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members.
 this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.
 criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject s cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead.
 in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours.
 the first oscars in one nine two nine lasted one five minutes.
 at the other end of the spectrum the two zero zero zero ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes.
 in two zero one zero the organizers of the academy awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past four five seconds.
 this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.
 the academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season.
 however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail .
 also a january ceremony would have to compete with national football league playoff games.
 awards ceremonies historically the oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when box office hits are favored to win the best picture trophy.

 from one nine three zero to one nine four three the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles.
 grauman s chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from one nine four four to one nine four six followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from one nine four seven to one nine four eight .
 the two one st academy awards in one nine four nine were held at the academy award theatre at what was the academy s headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood.
 from one nine five zero to one nine six zero the awards were presented at hollywood s pantages theatre .
 with the advent of television the awards from one nine five three to one nine five seven took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre one nine five three and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles.
 the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in one nine six one .
 by one nine six nine the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center .
 in two zero zero two the kodak theatre now known as the dolby theatre became the current venue of the presentation.
 awards of merit categories current categories in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two separate categories drama and comedy .
 at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedy musical .
 from the one nine three zero s through the one nine six zero s the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two separate categories black and white films and color films .
 prior to two zero one two the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup.
 another award entitled the academy award for best original musical is still in the academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued.
 however due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year it has not been awarded since one nine eight four when purple rain won .

 to date the following proposed categories have been rejected best casting rejected in one nine nine nine best stunt coordination rejected every year from one nine nine one to two zero one two best title design rejected in one nine nine nine special categories the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as a whole.

 this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than quality.
 no independent films have received the award though a few were nominated and no actors working outside of the studio system for a picture have won the award for their work in that picture.
 william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in two zero zero nine describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself .
 tim dirks editor of amc s filmsite.
org has written of the academy awards accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the u.
s.
 the last three months of the calendar year.
 the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded.
 from one nine two seven to two zero zero one around four nine of best picture nominated films had been categorized as a drama and out of the four three two films to be analyzed within that time four seven of the winning films were in fact dramas.
 this has led to the coining of the term oscar bait describing such movies.
 this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience e.
g.
 by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.
 symbolism or sentimentalization acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement for past mistakes or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work.
 refusing the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars.
 the first to do so was dudley nichols best writing in one nine three five for the informer .
 nichols boycotted the eight th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild.
 george c.
 scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in one nine seven zero for patton at the four three rd academy awards ceremony.
 scott described it as a meat parade saying i don t want any part of it.
 the third was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for one nine seven two s the godfather citing the film industry s discrimination and mistreatment of native americans.
 at the four five th academy awards ceremony brando sent sacheen littlefeather to read a one five page speech detailing his criticisms.

 it is the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth s surface and for terrestrial time which is used for astronomical calculations.
 when the last leap second was added tai is exactly three six seconds ahead of utc.
 the three six seconds results from the initial difference of one zero seconds at the start of one nine seven two plus two six leap seconds in utc since one nine seven two .
 time coordinates on the tai scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth.
 specifically both julian date s and the gregorian calendar are used.
 tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of one nine five eight and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth.
 operation tai as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over four zero zero atomic clock s in over five zero national laboratories worldwide.
 the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer .
 due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion .
 the majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the si second is written in terms of caesium .
 the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecode s which is their estimate of tai.
 time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a well known integer number of seconds.
 these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk .
 the tai form may be denoted tai npl .
 the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else.
 the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.
 the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.
 this combined time scale is published monthly in ftp ftp two .
bipm.
fr pub tai publication cirt circular t and is the canonical tai.
 this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc k equivalent to tai tai k for each participating institution k .
 the same circular also gives tables of tai ta k for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.
 errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t.
 aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised.
 in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.
 doing so does not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time tt .
 history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously.
 atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in one nine five five using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl .
 the greenwich atomic ga scale began in one nine five five at the royal greenwich observatory .
 the international time bureau bih began a time scale t m or am in july one nine five five using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals.
 the united states naval observatory began the a.
 one scale one three september one nine five six using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs a scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado .
 both the bih scale and a.
 one were defined by an epoch at the beginning of one nine five eight it was set to read julian date two four three six two zero four .
 five one january one nine five eight zero zero zero zero zero zero at the corresponding ut two instant.
 the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a three in one nine six three and ta bih in one nine six nine .
 this synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of ut two .
 at the time ut two as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.
 the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in one nine six seven and in one nine seven one the name international atomic time tai was assigned to a time scale based on si seconds with no leap seconds.
 during this time irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected.
 in one nine six seven it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates but this was disproven in one nine six eight .
 in the one nine seven zero s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.
 starting from julian date two four four three one four four .
 five one january one nine seven seven zero zero zero zero zero zero corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid .
 because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed down by about one part in a trillion.
 the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale .
 the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.
 all three of these time scales were defined to read jd two four four three one four four .
 five zero zero three seven two five one january one nine seven seven zero zero zero zero three two .
 one eight four exactly at that instant.
 the offset is to provide continuity with the older ephemeris time .
 tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai three two .
 one eight four s.
 the continued existence of tai was questioned in a two zero zero seven letter from the bipm to the itu r which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc.
 in one nine six one utc began.
 utc is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time the discontinuities being arranged so that utc approximated ut two until the end of one nine seven one and ut one thereafter.
 this was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale a linear transformation of the bih s atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised while approximating ut one means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.

 altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others.
 it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions.
 altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness .
 the word was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism.
 he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else .
 altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves e.
g.
 pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another third party individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.
 steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards .
 altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships.
 much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology.
 the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification .
 the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits .
 the actor also may not be expecting a reward.
 the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others.
 used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of one s self.
 the notion of altruism the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought.
 the term was originally coined in the one nine th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists .
 whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism.
 in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
 scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mauss s book the gift contains a passage note on alms.
 this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice.
 in it he writes alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other.
 generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it.
 this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice.
 the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.
 compare altruism ethics perception of altruism as self sacrifice .
 compare explanation of alms in various scriptures .
 evolutionary explanations giving alms to beggar children in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.
 in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public good s and environmentalism .
 theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins.
 two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.
 some of the proposed mechanisms are kin selection .
 that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures.
 even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior.
 one kinship cue is facial resemblance.
 one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons.
 another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helping behavior.
 another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group.
 using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study.
 this effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families.
 vested interests.
 people are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroup s suffer or even disappear.
 helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist.
 making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness.
 extreme self sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup.
 reciprocal altruism .
 see also reciprocity evolution .
 direct reciprocity .
 research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help.
 the effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example.
 many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.
 one consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future.
 people tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower.
 they tend to help less if they see non cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors.
 simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a community game instead of a wall street game.
 a tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them.
 this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity.
 another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation.
 the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped.
 on the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating.
 people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts.
 as such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non cooperation.
 people are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first.
 this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises.
 they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately.
 direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population.
 thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual s performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.
 indirect reciprocity.
 the avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person s reputation to become very important.
 a person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.
 strong reciprocity .
 a form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism.
 a number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
 pseudo reciprocity.
 an organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
 costly signaling and the handicap principle .
 since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources.
 this may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner.
 it may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling.
 it is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help.
 costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.
 hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else.
 similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one s resources.
 heroic risk taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.
 volunteers assist hurricane victims at the houston astrodome following hurricane katrina.
 both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions.
 one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else.
 this have been documented in many studies.
 the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen.
 weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.
 public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic.
 people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.
 women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners.
 when looking for a long term partner altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children.
 it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman.
 while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man.
 men may even avoid altruistic women in short term relationships which may be because they expect less success.
 people may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism .
 on the other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous.
 this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic.
 the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present.
 while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.
 explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards.
 this may be because such extrinsic top down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable.
 another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them.
 this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non cooperators.
 a counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.
 group selection .
 it has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as e.
 o.
 wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level.
 thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons.
 such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members see also in group favoritism .
 group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.
 helping the homeless in new york city such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts.
 instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors.
 every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment.
 this need not imply that on average five zero or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.
 the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups.
 research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.
 the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r.
 price s development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution.
 an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime mould s such as dictyostelium mucoroides.
 these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.
 selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.
 such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his one nine zero two book mutual aid a factor of evolution and peter singer in his book a darwinian left .
 initial evolutionary problematics there are problems of early stage evolution of altruism.
 a first emotionally empathic individual would if it was genetic have been effectively exploited to death by the preexisting non empathic individuals.
 this applies regardless how far back in evolution the problem is moved not restricted to hominid but extending to pre reptilian or anything in between including early mammals.
 the first empathic individual would effectively be exploited every time another individual was in the right place at the right time to take advantage so no evolutionary adaptation to exploiting empathic individuals would be required for the lethality to take effect.
 it is de facto impossible that mutations for emotional empathy ability to recognize it in others and a direction of it towards those individuals would all occur at the same time.
 an ability to recognize a non existent behavior is of no evolutionary use and so cannot have pre evolved.
 neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs d or hospital network j.
m.
 provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging .
 in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october two zero zero six they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex.
 however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region.
 these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species.
 altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable.
 psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing another s welfare.
 psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one s own welfare.
 there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.
 some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.
 however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question.
 the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.
 daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory.
 he identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism .
 altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.
 the empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering.
 feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions.
 people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another s suffering.
 helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.
 peace corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in cambodia four april two zero zero seven in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service.
 research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person s distress.
 research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect .
 greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.
 however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.
 a feeling of personal responsibility or moral norm has also strongly been associated with other pro social behaviors such as charitable giving.
 many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being.
 in a study of older adults those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live and significantly lower in depression anxiety and somatization .
 volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well.
 one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a three zero year period and found that five two of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only three six of those who did volunteer experienced one.
 a study on adults ages five five found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a six three lower likelihood of dying.
 after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a four four reduction in mortality.
 merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being.
 a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.
 it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder.
 the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional.
 studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states.
 studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.
 for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant .
 additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others.
 studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being.
 a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being.

 psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as the helper s high .

 the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field.
 the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa .
 this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies.
 how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society .
 pathological altruism pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well intentioned actions cause more harm than good.
 the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism .
 examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one s own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.
 religious viewpoints most if not all of the world s religions promote altruism as a very important moral value.
 buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc.
 place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
 buddhism monks collecting alms altruism figures prominently in buddhism.
 love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering.
 many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion.
 these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama .
 speech by the dalai lama the phrase core of our being is freudian see since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other.
 it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering.
 in practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously self centered buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic.
 many would agree with the dalai lama that buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.
 still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes dalai lama .
 in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect.
 a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what i cause if i cause suffering then as a natural consequence i will experience suffering if i cause happiness then as a natural consequence i will experience happiness.
 in buddhism karma p li kamma is strictly distinguished from vip ka meaning fruit or result .
 karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause p li hetu in the chain of cause and effect where it comprises the elements of volitional activities pali sankhara and action pali bhava .
 any action is understood to create seeds in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results p li vipaka when they meet the right conditions.
 most types of karmas with good or bad results will keep one in the wheel of sams ra others will liberate one to nirv na .
 buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action.
 motivation usually makes the difference between good and bad but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance so a well intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be bad in that it creates unpleasant results for the actor.
 in buddhism karma is not the only cause of all that happens.
 as taught in the early texts the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories known as niyama dhammas kamma niyama consequences of one s actions utu niyama seasonal changes and climate biija niyama laws of heredity citta niyama will of mind dhamma niyama nature s tendency to produce a perfect type jainism sculpture depicting the jain concept of ahimsa non injury the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings.
 jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i.
e.
 uncompromising reverence for all life.
 it also considers all living things to be equal.
 the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things.
 jainism prescribes a path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal.
 a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors.
 one s unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans.
 anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything.
 jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straight forwardness and greed by contentment.
 jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action.
 the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks.
 they are non violence ahimsa truthfulness satya non stealing asteya celibacy brahmacharya non possession or non materialism aparigraha the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders.
 the house holders are encouraged to practice the above mentioned five vows.
 the monks have to observe them very strictly.
 with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress.
 the principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul.
 jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism .
 because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one s actions.
 jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small.
 this policy extends even to microscopic organisms.
 jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.
 christianity statue of mother teresa in india altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain .
 from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between self affirmation and other regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests.
 in his book indoctrination and self deception roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self affirmation and altruism by analysis of other regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many.
 love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person s experience and practice from within.
 as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection.
 st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.
 considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part.
 however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being.
 in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism.
 many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god.
 one john four states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one s fellowman is the same as hatred of god.
 thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love.
 an altruistic action is not always a loving action.
 oord defines altruism as acting for the other s good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one s own good when the other s demands undermine overall well being.
 german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak.
 one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one s own life and existence .
 another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love .
.
.
 nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people s business.
 at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc.
 directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse.
 islam in islam the concept th r altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself .
 for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one s own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by allah on the human body considered to be property of allah alone.
 the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing th r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.
 this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in i thar attention is focused on everything in existence.
 a constant concern for allah i.
e.
 god results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world.
 this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like rabia al adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah i.
e.
 god and dedication to people.
 thirteenth century turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as yarat lan severiz yaratandan t r or we love the creature because of the creator.
 for many muslims i thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays.
 however i thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times.
 judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation.
 the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.
 this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism.
 this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god.
 kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence .
 rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.
 modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.
 ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another.
 ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity .
 sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion.
 the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness.
 the fifth nanak guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold two two carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth.
 the ninth guru guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity.
 in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh ji the tenth guru in sikhism was in war with the moghul rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy.
 he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield.
 some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy.
 sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji and complained of his action that they considered counter productive to their struggle on the battlefield.
 what were you doing and why asked the guru.
 i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya.
 the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds.
 you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru.
 it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism.
 this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.
 hinduism swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras a vedantic text.
 in his commentary on chapter three of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed.
 hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one s merit.
 furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit.
 since apurva is non sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god.
 it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.
 philosophy there exists a wide range of philosophical views on man s obligations or motivations to act altruistically.
 proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically.
 the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest.
 both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants.
 a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible.
 rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one s self interest without specifying how this affects one s moral obligations .

 although it used rand s screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements.
 atlas shrugged and objectivism in the years following the publication of the fountainhead rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom it profoundly influenced.
 in one nine five one rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers around her.
 this group jokingly designated the collective included future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal later nathaniel branden and his wife barbara and barbara s cousin leonard peikoff .
 at first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy.
 later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged as the manuscript pages were written.
 in one nine five four rand s close relationship with the younger nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses.
 atlas shrugged published in one nine five seven was considered rand s magnum opus .
 rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in man s existence and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest.
 it advocates the core tenets of rand s philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement.
 the plot involves a dystopia n united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy.
 the novel s hero and leader of the strike john galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation s wealth and achievement.
 with this fictional strike rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart.
 the novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains rand s most extensive statement of objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by galt.
 despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller.

 in one nine five eight nathaniel branden established nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rand s philosophy.
 collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited.
 rand later published some of these articles in book form.
 critics including some former nbi students and branden himself have described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion.
 rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.
 rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.
 however some former nbi students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among rand s closest followers in new york.
 later years throughout the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton columbia harvard and mit .
 she received an honorary doctorate from lewis bums supporting israel in the yom kippur war of one nine seven three against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying european colonists had the right to develop land taken from american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.
 she also endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in one nine six four whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter .
 grave marker for rand and her husband at kensico cemetery in valhalla new york alt a twin gravestone bearing the name frank o connor on the left and ayn rand o connor on the right in one nine six four nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married.
 nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand.
 when she learned of it in one nine six eight though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand terminated her relationship with both brandens which led to the closure of nbi.
 rand published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life .
 branden later apologized in an interview to every student of objectivism for perpetuating the ayn rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the objectivist movement.
 in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.
 rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in one nine seven four after decades of heavy smoking.
 in one nine seven six she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections allowed evva pryor a social worker from her attorney s office to enroll her in social security and medicare .

 one of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged .
 rand died of heart failure on march six one nine eight two at her home in new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york .
 rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan .
 a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.
 in her will rand named leonard peikoff the heir to her estate.
 philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute.
 she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics .
 in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion.
 in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiom atic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses.
 she rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing.
 rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization which she summarized in the form of a philosophical razor .
 known as rand s razor it states that concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity the corollary of which is nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity.
 in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy .
 in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle.
 she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.
 she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man s survival qua man .
 she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites.
 rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.
 she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship .
 rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.
 although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism .
 she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.
 she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism .
 she rejected anarchism as a na ve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.
 rand s aesthetics defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments.
 according to rand art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.
 as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will .
 she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism .
 rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three a s aristotle aquinas and ayn rand.
 in a one nine five nine interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me.
 i devised the rest of my philosophy myself.
 however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand s journals in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style.
 however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche s ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.
 among the philosophers rand held in particular disdain was immanuel kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences.
 rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts her ethics and her discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force.
 she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason.
 if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows.
 reception and legacy reviews during rand s lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation.
 rand s first novel we the living was admired by the literary critic h.
 l.
 mencken her broadway play night of january one six th was both a critical and popular success and the fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in the new york times as masterful .
 rand s novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.
 however they became bestseller s largely through word of mouth.
 the first reviews rand received were for night of january one six th .
 reviews of the production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.
 rand believed that her first novel we the living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael s.
 berliner says it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately one two five different reviews being published in more than two zero zero publications.
 overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.
 her one nine three eight novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues.
 rand s first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed.
 there was a positive review in the new york times that rand greatly appreciated.
 the reviewer called rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time .
 there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.
 some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing .
 other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand s style offensively pedestrian .
 rand s one nine five seven novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative.
 in the national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly .
 he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas chamber go atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity .
 author flannery o connor wrote in a letter to a friend that the fiction of ayn rand is as low as you can get re fiction.
 i hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail.
 rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had.
 the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality .
 her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.
 on the one zero zero th anniversary of rand s birth in two zero zero five edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society .
 in two zero zero seven book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudo philosophy .
 in two zero zero nine gq s critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalism s version of middlebrow religious novels such as ben hur and the left behind series.

 rand s work continues to be among the top sellers among books in india.
 rand s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as ira levin kay nolte smith and l.

s.
 postage stamp designed by artist nick gaetano .
 political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism.
 jim powell a senior fellow at the cato institute considers rand one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson of modern american libertarianism and david nolan one of the founders of the libertarian party stated that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist .
 in his history of the libertarian movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right .
 a protester at an april two zero zero nine tea party rally carries a sign referring to john galt the hero of rand s novel atlas shrugged alt in a large outdoor crowd a man holds up a poster with the words i am john galt in all capital letters she faced intense opposition from william f.
 buckley jr.
 and other contributors for the national review magazine.
 they published numerous criticisms in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s by whittaker chambers garry wills and m.
 stanton evans .
 nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.
 the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the united states republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being pro choice and an atheist.
 a one nine eight seven article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administration s novelist laureate .
 republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.
 the late two zero zero zero s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis and opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel.
 during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests .
 there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan .
 for example mother jones remarked that rand s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while equating randian individual well being with that of the volk according to goebbels.
 corey robin of the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism.
 academic reaction during rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.
 when the first academic book about rand s philosophy appeared in one nine seven one its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously.
 a few articles about rand s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in one nine eight two many of them in the personalist .
 one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is ought problem posed by david hume .
 some responses to nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in the personalist arguing that nozick misstated rand s case.
 academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited.
 academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand s novels when she began researching her in one nine seven three and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the one nine seven zero s.
 since rand s death interest in her work has gradually increased.
 historian jennifer burns has identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand the most recent of which is an explosion of scholarship since the year two zero zero zero .
 however few universities currently include rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.
 gladstein chris matthew sciabarra allan gotthelf edwin a.
 locke and tara smith have taught her work in academic institutions.
 sciabarra co edits the journal of ayn rand studies a nonpartisan peer reviewed journal dedicated to the study of rand s philosophical and literary work.
 in one nine eight seven gotthelf helped found the ayn rand society with george walsh and david kelley and has been active in sponsoring seminars about rand and her ideas.
 smith has written several academic books and papers on rand s ideas including ayn rand s normative ethics the virtuous egoist a volume on rand s ethical theory published by cambridge university press .
 rand s ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities.
 scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the one nine nine zero s.
 rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b.
 rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional .
 philosopher jack wheeler says that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand s ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought.
 in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in two zero zero one john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation .
 in a one nine nine nine interview in the chronicle of higher education sciabarra commented i know they laugh at rand while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.
 libertarian philosopher michael huemer has argued that very few people find rand s ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.
 he attributes the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist.
 thus atlas shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat but also rand s own non fiction works.
 political scientist charles murray while praising rand s literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche .
 although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert h.
 bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.
 objectivist movement in one nine eight five rand s heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rand s ideas and works.
 in one nine nine zero philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas society .
 in two zero zero one historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia.
 the charitable foundation of bb t corporation has also given grants for teaching rand s ideas or works.
 the university of texas at austin the university of pittsburgh and university of north carolina at chapel hill are among the schools that have received grants.
 in some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to rand.

 as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew.
 by the two nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged.
 two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage.
 west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean.
 the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of massinissa in the two nd century bc.
 after masinissa s death in one four eight bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.
 massinissa s line survived until two four ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire .
 upright nail berber king masinissa for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region.
 like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products.
 saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modern day algeria located in the roman province of africa .
 the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in four two nine and by four three five controlled coastal numidia.
 they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived lepcis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival.
 upright jugurtha middle ages mansourah mosque tlemcen fatimid caliphate at its greatest extent.
 after negligible resistance from the locals the arabs conquered algeria in the mid seven th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith.
 after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the aghlabids almohads abdalwadid zirids rustamids hammadids almoravids and the fatimids .
 during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to suggest the afroasiatic language family the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari as well as the emirs abd al mu min and y ghm rasen .
 it was during this time period that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb.
 these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy primarily made of arabs and levant ians extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo .
 the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded.
 in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them.
 the resultant war is recounted in the epic t ghrib t .
 in al t ghr b t the amazigh zirid hero kh l f al z nat asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero bu zayd al hilal and many other arab knights in a string of victories.
 the zirid s however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture.
 the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids .
 the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen .
 caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era.
 the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes.
 the two main branches were the botr and barn s tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes.
 each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houaras zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata .
 all these tribes made independent territorial decisions.
 several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands.
 ibn khaldun provides a table summarizing the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties.
 in the early one six th century spain constructed fortified outposts presidio s on or near the algerian coast.
 spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in one five zero five oran in one five zero nine and tlemcen mostaganem and t n s in one five one zero .
 in the same year few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to spain which built a fort on it.
 the presidios in north africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for spain s merchant fleet.
 arabization reigned in ifriqiya current tunisia a berber family zirid somehow recognizing the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo .
 probably in one zero four eight the zirid ruler or viceroy el mu izz decided to end this suzerainty.
 the fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition the viceroy el mu izz also found another means of revenge.
 between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot.
 the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign.
 this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimid treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.
 whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment.
 some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabe s region.
 the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but each meeting the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and arabs remained masters of the field.
 the flood was still rising and in one zero five seven the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad as they had done kairouan few decades ago.
 from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the one two th century.
 we can say that in the one three thcentury there were in all of north africa with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely berber .

 in one five one six the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers.
 they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler abu hamo musa iii of the bani ziyad dynasty to flee.
 when aruj was killed in one five one eight during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers.

 although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empire.
 the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat.
 the dey was elected for a life term but in the one five nine years one six seven one one eight three zero that the system survived fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated.
 despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of ottomon government was remarkably orderly.

 autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency s authority was seldom applied in the kabylie .

 its main subdivisions are social and cultural anthropology which describes the workings of societies around the world linguistic anthropology which investigates the influence of language in social life and biological or physical anthropology which concerns long term development of the human organism.
 archaeology which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the united states although in europe it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under related disciplines such as history.
 eric r.
 wolf states ideas about race culture and peoplehood or ethnicity have long served to orient anthropology s inquiries .
.
.
 origin and development of the term the abstract noun is first attested in reference to history .
 its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann .
 their new latin derived from the combining form s of the greek words nthr pos human and l gos study .
 its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle .
 it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early one eight th century.
 through the one nine th century in one six four seven the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows anthropology that is to say the science that treats of man is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy which considers the body and the parts and psychology which speaks of the soul.
 sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by tienne serres in one eight three eight to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in one eight five zero at the national museum of natural history france by jean louis armand de quatrefages de br au .
 various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed.
 the soci t ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in one eight three nine .
 its members were primarily anti slavery activists.
 when slavery was abolished in france in one eight four eight the soci t was abandoned.
 meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in one eight four two as well as the ethnological society of london in one eight four three a break away group of the aborigines protection society .
 these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists.
 they maintained international connections.
 anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier one nine th century.
 theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.
 for them the publication of charles darwin s on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect.
 darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild.
 darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late one eight five zero s.
 there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences.
 paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the soci t de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the soci t d anthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in one eight five nine .
 when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism .
 his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature .
 broca being what today would be called a neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech.
 he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech.
 he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called broca s area after him.
 his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturv lker one eight five nine one eight six four .
 the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples .
 the last two volumes were published posthumously.
 waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man .
 by nature he meant matter animated by the divine breath i.
e.
 he was an animist .
 following broca s lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him .
 he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation.
 the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison.
 it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men .
 waitz was influential among the british ethnologists.
 in one eight six three the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology.
 it was the two nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence.
 representatives from the french soci t were present though not broca.
 in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard.
 among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist.
 previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist.
 similar organizations in other countries followed the american anthropological association in one nine zero two the anthropological society of madrid one eight six five the anthropological society of vienna one eight seven zero the italian society of anthropology and ethnology one eight seven one and many others subsequently.
 the majority of these were evolutionist.
 one notable exception was the one eight six nine founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists.
 not religious himself he insisted that darwin s conclusions lacked empirical foundation.
 during the last three decades of the one nine th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association.
 the major theorists belonged to these organizations.
 they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning.
 by one eight nine eight the american association for the advancement of science was able to report that four eight educational institutions in one three countries had some curriculum in anthropology.
 none of the seven five faculty members were under a department named anthropology.
 two zero th and two one st centuries this meagre statistic expanded in the two zero th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world s higher educational institutions many thousands in number.
 anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more.
 practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene.
 organization has reached global level.
 for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations.
 since the work of franz boas and bronis aw malinowski in the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross cultural comparisons long term in depth examination of context and the importance it places on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research.
 cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.
 this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against one nine th century racial ideology through margaret mead s advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism .
 ethnography is one of its primary research design s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.
 in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate.
 in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early two zero th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology and archaeology plus anthropological linguistics .
 these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.
 european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology a term coined and defined by adam f.
 koll r in one seven eight three .
 in non colonial european countries social anthropology is now defined as the study of social organization in non state societies.
 it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition.
 fields anthropology is a global discipline where humanities social and natural sciences are forced to confront one another.
 anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc.
 early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity.
 as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late two zero th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies .
 according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies.
 during the one nine seven zero s and one nine nine zero s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline.
 during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology.
 in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist.
 due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.
 sociocultural sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology .
 cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups.
 cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how one s culture affects experience for self and group contributing to more complete understanding of the people s knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history.
 in that it helps develop understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc.
 .
 there is no hard and fast distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.
 inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.
 accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross cultural comparison.
 this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography .
 ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research i.
e.
 an ethnographic monograph.
 as methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within a community or other research site.
 participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.
 ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures.
 the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic conceptual vs.
 etic or technical point of view.
 the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal .
 sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology .
 comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized and de industrialized west.
 cultures in the standard cross cultural sample sccs of world societies are biological forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains such as these found lying in scrub in western australia c.
 one nine zero zero one nine one zero .
 biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions.
 it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.
 archaeological excavations at the three eight zero zero year old edgewater park site iowa archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.
 artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies.
 archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices.
 ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.
 linguistic linguistic anthropology also called anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture.
 it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes.
 linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis.
 key topics by field sociocultural art media music dance and film art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon.
 several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most non western contexts.
 to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities.
 boas primitive art claude l vi strauss the way of the masks one nine eight two or geertz s art as cultural system one nine eight three are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics .
 media upright a punu tribe mask.
 gabon central africa media anthropology also known as anthropology of media or mass media emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media.
 the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production e.
g.
 ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media.
 other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education.
 this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early one nine nine zero s.
 music ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
 visual visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid one nine nine zero s new media .
 while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media .
 visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.
 economic political economic applied and development economic economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope.
 it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical.
 its origins as a sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronislaw malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange.
 economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange.
 the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast.
 economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.
 political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies.
 political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture.
 three main areas of interest rapidly developed.
 the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes.
 sahlins work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image.
 the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world s population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam.
 the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system.
 more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and post industrial capitalism around the world.
 applied applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems.
 it is a complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy .
 more simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community.
 it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of development .
 development anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective.
 the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship feminism gender and sexuality kinship kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves.
 over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent group s lineage s affine s cognates and even fictive kinship .
 broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent one s social relations during development and also relatives by marriage.
 feminist feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge.
 anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists.
 historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world .
 feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory .
 feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies.
 feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as a specialization.
 medical nutritional psychological cognitive and transpersonal medical medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation .
 currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole.
 it focuses on the following six basic fields the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care the patient physician relationship the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments the interaction of social environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations critical ethnopsychiatry beneduce two zero zero four two zero zero seven the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non western settings other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer one nine nine nine two zero zero three beneduce two zero one zero as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness.
 on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry .
 nutritional nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter.
 if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization.
 nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people.
 psychological psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes .
 this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group with its own history language practices and conceptual categories shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health .
 it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.
 cognitive cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms.
 cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.
 transpersonal transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture.
 as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience .
 however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences young and goulet one nine nine four .
 political and legal political political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies.
 political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the one nine six zero s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena.
 the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels.
 first of all anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere as in patron client relations or tribal political organization .
 second of all anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions .
 an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today.
 geertz comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example.
 legal legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering .
 earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation.
 more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings.
 public public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change borofsky two zero zero four .
 nature science and technology cyborg cyborg anthropology originated as a sub focus group within the american anthropological association s annual meeting in one nine nine three .
 the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science .
 donna haraway s one nine eight five cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term.
 cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.
 digital digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect.
 it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture .
 the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases.
 these include techno anthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology.
 ecological ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptation s to environments .
 the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment .
 the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems .
 environmental environmental anthropology is a sub specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.
 the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology .
 many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues and more.
 the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land.
 often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies .
 such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park.
 historical ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records .
 it is also the study of the history of various ethnic group s that may or may not exist today.
 ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation.
 its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts.
 practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names.
 religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures.
 modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it.
 urban urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism .
 ulf hannerz quotes a one nine six zero s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition .
 various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes.
 there are two principle approaches in urban anthropology by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities.
 these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other.
 by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities.
 by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.
 key topics by field archaeological and biological anthrozoology anthrozoology also known as human animal studies is the study of interaction between living things.
 it is a burgeoning interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology .
 a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.
 it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy.
 biocultural biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture.
 physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the two zero th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences.
 after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.
 evolutionary evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primate s.
 evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors.
 evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present.
 it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics .
 it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present.
 forensic forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victim s remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition .
 a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable.
 the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.
 palaeoanthropology paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology .
 it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints.
 organizations contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges.
 the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association aaa which was founded in one nine zero three .
 membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe.
 in one nine eight nine a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists easa which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe.
 the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.
 hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.

 some commentators have contended that the discipline grew out of colonialism perhaps was in league with it and derived some of its key notions from it consciously or not.
 see for example gough pels and salemink but cf.
 lewis two zero zero four .
 that ethnographic work was often ahistorical writing about people as if they were out of time in an ethnographic present johannes fabian time and its other .
 ethics of cultural relativism as part of their quest for scientific objectivity present day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology.
 this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another s values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms.
 there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture.
 ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture .
 topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man s inhumanity to man .
 to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields.
 ethical stance to military involvement anthropologists involvement with the u.
s.
 government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline.
 franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists.
 but by the one nine four zero s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan .
 many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information .
 at the same time david h.
 price s work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.
 attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little although anthropologist hugo nutini was active in the stillborn project camelot .
 many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement.
 numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa .
 professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state .
 their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings.
 the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous.
 the aaa s current statement of professional responsibility clearly states that in relation with their own government and with host governments .
.
.
 no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.
 anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us army s strategy in afghanistan.
 the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq .
 in two zero zero nine the american anthropological association s commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency and in a potentially coercive environment all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.
 in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod.
 aaa commission releases final report on army human terrain system american anthropological association post world war ii developments before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions.
 after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology.
 basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work.
 one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.
 the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.
 in the one nine nine zero s and two zero zero zero s decade calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard.
 these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological.
 biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures .
 they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork.
 on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.
 along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions.
 human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology.
 further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.
 anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences.
 by making comparisons across cultural traditions time based and cultural regions space based anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science.
 commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.
 some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space non european non western societies .
 for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late one nine six zero s.
 now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author s home .
 it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west.
 in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologist s but this is increasingly changing starting in the one nine seven zero s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc aug le centre d anthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies .
 since the one nine eight zero s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale.
 there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.

 however they cover different concepts agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use.

 agricultural biotechnology agricultural biotechnology is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques including genetic engineering molecular markers molecular diagnostics vaccines and tissue culture to modify living organisms plants animals and microorganisms .
 fertilizer one of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.
 yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue which can take a few months to several years to decompose depending on the crop s c to n ratio and the local environment a local science with the exception of theoretical agronomy research in agronomy more than in any other field is strongly related to local areas.
 it can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another.
 many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally.
 others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interaction with nature.
 history of agricultural science agricultural science began with gregor mendel s genetic work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in one eight th century germany.
 in the united states a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of one eight eight seven which used the term agricultural science .
 the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer.
 the smith hughes act of one nine one seven shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built.
 after one nine zero six public expenditures on agricultural research in the us exceeded private expenditures for the next four four years.
 intensification of agriculture since the one nine six zero s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizer s and phytosanitary product s.
 as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields.
 these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non essential economic goods .
 in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.
 new technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming .
 balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human nature interactions of traditional agriculture including interaction of religion and agriculture and the non material components of agricultural production systems.

 alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout egypt and eurasia which aimed to purify mature and perfect certain objects.
 common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metal s e.
g.
 lead into noble ones particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality the creation of panacea s able to cure any disease and the development of an alkahest a universal solvent .
 the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and in the hellenistic and western tradition the achievement of gnosis .
 in europe the creation of a philosopher s stone was variously connected with all of these projects.
 in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the far east the indian subcontinent and the muslim world .
 in europe following the one two th century renaissance produced by the translation of arabic works on science and the recovery of aristotle alchemist s played a significant role in early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine .
 islamic and european alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today.
 however they continued antiquity s belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism.
 their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic mythology and religion .
 modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite the arguments of scholars like homyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary.
 the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of protochemistry medicine and charlatanism .
 the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists .
 the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.
 despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in a mix of greek philosophy was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as bolus of mendes s three rd century on physical and mystical matters .
 name the word alchemy was borrowed from old french alquemie alkimie taken from medieval latin alchymia and which is in turn borrowed from arabic al k miy philosopher s stone .
 the arabic word is borrowed from late greek ch me a ch m a black magic with the agglutination of the arabic definite article al .
 this ancient greek word was derived from the early greek name for egypt ch mia based on the egyptian name for egypt k me hieroglyphic khmi lit.
 black earth as opposed to red desert sand .
 the medieval latin form was influenced by greek chymeia meaning mixture and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry .
 history alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents.
 these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships.
 one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be largely independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and its zone of cultural influence indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe .
 chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of but influenced by various western religion s.
 it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other.
 hellenistic egypt ambix cucurbit and retort of zosimos from marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs three vol.
 paris one eight eight seven one eight eight eight .
 the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods.
 here elements of technology religion mythology and hellenistic philosophy each with their own much longer histories combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the west.
 zosimos of panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy while mary the jewess is credited as being the first non fictitious western alchemist.
 they wrote in greek and lived in egypt under roman rule.
 mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.
 alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.
 these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others.
 the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thrice great hermes .
 his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes .
 hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemy s principal symbols.
 according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge.
 the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners.
 these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.
 technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to three five zero zero .
 many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria two nine two .
 few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x .
 dating from three zero zero five zero zero they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver.
 these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudo democritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements .
 between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art.
 philosophy alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy s character.
 an important example of alchemy s roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire .
 according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.
 the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are .
.
.
true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word.
 the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.
 later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.
 alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity .
 lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth.
 st augustine later affirmed this in the four th four zero zero greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.
 by the middle of the seven th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline.
 it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the eight th and nine th centuries.
 india the vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold.
 the use of mercury for alchemy is first documented in the three rd or four th century arthashastra .
 buddhist texts from the two nd to five th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold.
 greek alchemy may have been introduced to ancient india through the invasions of alexander the great in three two five and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the greeks like gandh ra although hard evidence for this is lacking.
 the one one th century persian chemist and physician ab rayh n b r n who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body sanskrit divya deham and immortality while still embodied sanskrit j van mukti .
 sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess dev .
 some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath .
 other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kaly ak rakam of ugr ditya written in south india in the early nine th century.
 two famous early indian alchemical authors were n g rjuna siddha and nityan tha siddha.
 n g rjuna siddha was a buddhist monk.
 his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine.
 nityan tha siddha wrote rasaratn kara also a highly influential work.
 in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and n g rjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.
 reliable scholarship on indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white.
 trustworthy scholarship on indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account.
 an important modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has also been provided by david gordon white at oxford bibliographies online .
 the contents of three nine sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g.
 jan meulenbeld s history of indian medical literature .
 the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating.
 chapter one three of himl various works on rasa stra and ratna stra or various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of a further six five five six hundred and fifty five treatises.
 in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles.
 a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature.
 the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet two zero one four been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy.
 muslim world jabir ibn hayyan geber considered the father of chemistry introduced a scientific and experiment al approach to alchemy.
 after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world.
 much more is known about islam ic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations.
 the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al k miy .
 the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy.
 plato nic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late seven th and early eight th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship.
 in the late eight th century j bir ibn hayy n latinized as geber or geberus introduced a new approach to alchemy based on scientific method ology and controlled experiment ation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work.
 jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier .
 the science historian paul kraus wrote jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan al kindi alkindus and muhammad ibn zakar ya r zi rasis or rhazes contributed a number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acid s and more.
 the discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.
 islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism.
 the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir.
 jabir s ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life.
 he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness .
 according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior.
 for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist.
 thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result.
 by this reasoning the search for the philosopher s stone was introduced to western alchemy.
 jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance s name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element s physical properties.
 the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir.
 his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical element s aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical element s representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.
 shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity.
 the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir.
 from the nine th to one four th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus ab al rayh n al b r n avicenna and ibn khaldun .
 in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals .
 east asia upright zero .
 five taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the taijitu .
 whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.
 the philosopher s stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists.
 however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher s stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.
 black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists.
 as previously stated above chinese alchemy was more related to medicine.
 it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life.
 described in nine th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the one zero th century it was used in cannon s by one two nine zero .
 from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongol s the muslim world and europe.
 gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in one two four one and in europe by the one four th century.
 chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu although some tai chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of taoism not alchemical .
 in fact in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide .
 thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc.
 .
 medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosopher s stone by joseph wright one seven seven one the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to one one february one one four four with the completion of robert of chester s translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy .
 although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing.
 the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in one two th century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath .
 translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and al razi .
 these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent.
 alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples.
 meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought.
 the one one th century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context.
 in the early one two th century peter abelard followed anselm s work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west.
 in the early one three th century robert grosseteste used abelard s methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations.
 grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking.
 through much of the one two th and one three th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made.
 the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists.
 in the one three th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms.
 albertus magnus a dominican monk is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time.
 albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals.
 from the time shortly after his death through to the one five th century more than two eight alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.
 likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to albert s student thomas aquinas .
 roger bacon a franciscan monk who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time.
 while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy s connections to soteriology and christian theology.
 bacon s writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life.
 his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.
 like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres.
 he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time.
 the practical however confirmed the theoretical thought experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.
 in later european legend however bacon became an archmage.
 in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner s questions.
 soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared.
 his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods.
 it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described.
 by the end of the one three th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief.
 adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul .
 they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated.
 finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observation s and theories about how the universe operated.
 their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam.
 by purifying the two parts of man s soul man could be reunited with god.
 in the one four th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars.
 alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.
 dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars.
 pope john xxii s one three one seven edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists.
 in one four zero three henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv .
 these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone.
 the one four th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova.
 nicolas flamel is a well known alchemist but a good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous.
 though the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in one six one two .
 flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher s stone .
 his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations.
 most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosopher s stone.
 through the one four th and one five th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone.
 bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions.
 their cryptic allusions and symbol ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.
 renaissance and early modern europe page from alchemic treatise of ramon llull one six th century.
 during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy.
 the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.
 in the late one five th century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin.
 these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent.
 renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.
 esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala.
 a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa one four eight six one five three five who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists.
 in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermetism and alchemy.
 he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy.
 philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim one four nine three one five four one cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippa s occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia .
 paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver.
 for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.
 his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm.
 he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.
 paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyrics a synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula .
 iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus.
 john dee one three july one five two seven december one six zero eight followed agrippa s occult tradition.
 though better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dee s alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in one five six four was his most popular and influential work.
 his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below .
 during the one seven th century a short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole .
 proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher s stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels.

 entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of renaissance europe.
 alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones.
 rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late one six th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley .
 king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick l neburg henry v duke of brunswick l neburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists.
 john s son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus .
 though most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance.
 betr ger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage.
 legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artist s.
 false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.
 the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day.
 there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic.
 for example tycho brahe one five four six one six zero one an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute.
 michael sendivogius micha s dziw j one five six six one six three six a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around one six zero zero .
 sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in one six two one applied this in a submarine.
 isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newton s occult studies than he did to either optics or physics.
 other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont .
 their hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.
 decline robert boyle the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom .
 although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the one seven th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the one eight th century.
 as late as one seven eight one james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold.
 early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and anti aristotelian paracelsian and anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof.
 robert boyle one six two seven one six nine one pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations.
 he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data.
 boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant.
 this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the one eight th and one nine th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton .
 beginning around one seven two zero a rigid distinction was drawn between alchemy and chemistry for the first time.
 by the one seven four zero s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.
 in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to separate and divorce the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy.
 this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the one nine th and two zero th centuries and even to the present day.
 during the occult revival of the early one nine th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science.
 the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the one nine th century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.
 this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes.
 in the one nine th century revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy.
 both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy.
 atwood s work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner .
 hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists one eight five five attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state.
 in one eight four five baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.
 modern historical research the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study.
 as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements.
 institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism exeseso the european society for the study of western esotericism esswe and the university of amsterdam s sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents.
 a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam.
 journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society.

 from spiegel der kunst und natur .
 western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born.
 concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology .
 as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity .
 similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature.
 the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher s stone .
 hermetism in the eyes of a variety of esoteric and hermetic practitioners alchemy is fundamentally spiritual.
 transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection.
 the writings attributed to hermes trismegistus are a primary source of alchemical theory.
 he is named alchemy s founder and chief patron authority inspiration and guide .
 early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis c.
 ad three zero zero highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.
 this approach continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation.
 in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were a blind hiding their true spiritual philosophy .
 practitioners and patrons such as melchior cibinensis and pope innocent viii existed within the ranks of the church while martin luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with christian teachings.
 both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosopher s stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible.
 applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal.
 in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbol s diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.
 in his one seven six six alchemical catechism th odore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol magnum opus the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.

 those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m.
 principe and william r.
 newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances.
 these practitioners have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.
 at the opposite end of the spectrum esoteric alchemists interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts.
 today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements.
 groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism.
 since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances.
 which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought.
 traditional medicine traditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques.
 in ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity.
 these processes are actively used to the present day.
 spagyrists of the two zero th century albert richard riedel and jean dubuis merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods.
 the schools they founded les philosophes de la nature and the paracelsus research society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.
 the courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice.
 psychology alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung .
 initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images after being given a copy of the translation of the secret of the golden flower a chinese alchemical text by his friend richard wilhelm jung discovered a direct correlation between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the internal or psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients.
 he called the creation of the gold or lapis within the process of individuation .
 together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marie louise von franz jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available and poured over them.
 the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy s popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage.
 his writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding of the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that influence all of life.
 both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture.
 jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume one four of his collected works mysterium conuinctionis.
 literature alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment.

 in the one four th century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett.
 visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy.
 while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work.
 music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers.
 in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games.

 one the astronomer by johannes vermeer an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who studies star s planet s moon s comets and galaxies as well as many other celestial object s either in observational astronomy in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy .

 academic galileo is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy guy consolmagno vatikan observatory analyzing a meteorite two zero one four emily lakdawalla at the planetary conference two zero one three historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws.
 today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable.
 professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.
 they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory.
 the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small.
 the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately seven zero zero zero members.
 this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.
 the international astronomical union comprises almost one zero one four five members from seven zero different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond.
 contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a charge coupled device ccd camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time.
 before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation.
 modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year.
 analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time.
 astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes.
 most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetarium s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.
 amateur astronomers while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs .
 most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties .
 the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from seven zero different nations.
 like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research.
 however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

 ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is a character encoding scheme the iana prefers the name us ascii .
 ascii codes represent text in computers communications equipment and other devices that use text.
 most modern character encoding schemes are based on ascii though they support many additional characters.
 ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december two zero zero seven when it was surpassed by utf eight which includes ascii as a subset.
 ascii developed from telegraphic codes .
 its first commercial use was as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services.
 work on the ascii standard began on october six one nine six zero with the first meeting of the american standards association s asa x three .
 two subcommittee.
 the first edition of the standard was published during one nine six three underwent a major revision during one nine six seven and experienced its most recent update during one nine eight six .
 compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting i.
e.
 alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters.
 originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes one two eight specified characters into seven bit integers as shown by the ascii chart on the right.
 the characters encoded are numbers zero to nine lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters a to z basic punctuation symbol s control code s that originated with teletype machine s and a space .
 for example lowercase j would become binary one one zero one zero one zero and decimal one zero six .
 ascii includes definitions for one two eight characters three three are non printing control character s many now obsolete that affect how text and space are processed and nine five printable characters including the space which is considered an invisible graphic .

 two subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems.
 like other character encoding s ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols i.
e.
 grapheme s and control character s .
 this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language.
 before ascii was developed the encodings in use included two six alphabetic characters one zero numerical digit s and from one one to two five special graphic symbols.
 to include all these and control characters compatible with the comit consultatif international t l phonique et t l graphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no.
 two ita two standard fieldata and early ebcdic more than six four codes were required for ascii.
 the committee debated the possibility of a shift function like in ita two which would allow more than six four codes to be represented by a six bit code .
 in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.
 it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable.
 the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a seven bit code.
 the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits octet s would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal .
 however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice.
 the committee voted to use a seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission.
 since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired.
 eight bit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to zero .
 organization the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification.
 the first two columns three two positions were reserved for control characters.
 the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position two zero hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.
 the committee decided it was important to support uppercase six four character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable six four character set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code.
 lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase.
 to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position four one hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard.
 the digits zero nine were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with zero one one making conversion with binary coded decimal straightforward.
 many of the non alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters.
 mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no.
 two one eight seven eight the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of two three four five six seven eight nine were were placed in second column rows one five corresponding to the digits one five in the adjacent column.
 the parentheses could not correspond to nine and zero however because the place corresponding to zero was taken by the space character.
 this was accommodated by removing underscore from six and shifting the remaining characters left which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with eight and nine .
 this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit paired keyboard s notably the teletype model three three which used the left shifted layout corresponding to ascii not to traditional mechanical typewriters.
 electric typewriters notably the more recently introduced ibm selectric one nine six one used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the ibm pc one nine eight one especially model m one nine eight four and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did.
 the pair also dates to the no.
 two and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no.
 two did not shift comma or .
 full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting .
 however ascii split the pair dating to no.
 two and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to .
 some common characters were not included notably while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common .
 the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position four zero hex right before the letter a.
 the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you wru are you ru a reserved device control dc zero synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack .
 these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns.
 publication with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa x three .
 four one nine six three leaving two eight code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code.
 there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.
 the indecision did not last long during may one nine six three the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to columns six and seven and international organization for standardization tc nine seven sc two voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard.
 the x three .
 two .
 four task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may one nine six three meeting.
 locating the lowercase letters in columns six and seven caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.
 the x three committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed .
 ascii was subsequently updated as usasi x three .
 four one nine six seven then usasi x three .
 four one nine six eight ansi x three .
 four one nine seven seven and finally ansi x three .
 four one nine eight six the first two are occasionally retronamed ansi x three .
 four one nine six seven and ansi x three .
 four one nine six eight .
 the x three committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape.
 they proposed a nine track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some forms of punched card formats.
 use ascii itself was first used commercially during one nine six three as a seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe .
 because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii.
 on march one one one nine six eight u.
s.
 president lyndon b.
 johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.
 all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july one one nine six nine must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.
 other standards other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso iec six four six that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdom s pound sterling .
 almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries.
 for example canada had its own version that supported french characters.
 other adapted encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam and yuscii yugoslavia .
 although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard.
 ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first one two eight symbols so the seven bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets.
 this allows utf eight to be backward compatible with seven bit ascii as a utf eight file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters.
 even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only seven bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support eight bit ascii extensions such as iso eight eight five nine one will preserve utf eight data unchanged.
 ascii control characters ascii reserves the first three two codes numbers zero three one decimal for control character s codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.
 for example character one zero represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character eight represents backspace .
 rfc two eight two two refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters.
 except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document.
 other schemes such as markup language s address page and document layout and formatting.
 the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character.
 the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete .
 probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model three three asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option.
 paper tape was a very popular medium for long term program storage until the one nine eight zero s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape.
 in particular the teletype model three three machine assignments for codes one seven control q dc one also known as xon one nine control s dc three also known as xoff and one two seven delete became de facto standards.
 the model three three was also notable for taking the description of control g bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character.
 because the keytop for the o key also showed a left arrow symbol from ascii one nine six three which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code one five control o shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.
 when a teletype three three asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control s xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving control q xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume.
 this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique.
 on some systems control s retains its meaning but control q is replaced by a second control s to resume output.
 the three three asr also could be configured to employ control r dc two and control t dc four to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively.
 code one two seven is officially named delete but the teletype label was rubout .
 since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied.
 the original teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as nul all zeroes .
 this was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the all ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.
 tapes designed to be hand edited could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls blank tape so that a block of characters could be rubbed out and then replacements put into the empty space.
 some software assigned special meanings to ascii characters sent to the software from the terminal.
 operating systems from digital equipment corporation for example interpreted del as an input character as meaning remove previously typed input character and this interpretation also became common in unix systems.
 most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean remove the character at the cursor .
 that latter interpretation is the most common now.
 many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones.
 the escape character esc code two seven for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning.
 this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning.
 over time this meaning has been co opted and has eventually been changed.
 in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so called ansi escape code or more properly a control sequence introducer beginning with esc followed by a left bracket character.
 an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editor s.
 in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether.
 the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems.
 the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating system s.
 teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead .
 the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.
 the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.
 dec operating systems os eight rt one one rsx one one rsts tops one zero etc.
 used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work.
 by the time so called glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention.
 when gary kildall cloned rt one one to create cp m he followed established dec convention.
 until the introduction of pc dos in one nine eight one ibm had no hand in this because their one nine seven zero s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless.
 ibm s pc dos also marketed as ms dos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cp m and windows inherited it from ms dos.
 unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone.
 to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as a line terminator.
 unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics.
 the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as a line terminator however since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix based os x operating system they now use line feed lf as well.
 computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops one zero and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os three six zero that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii.
 the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network.
 telnet used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt.
 the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode.
 this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for e mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvt s cr lf line ending convention.
 older operating systems such as tops one zero along with cp m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control z sub to mark the end of the actual text in the file.
 for this reason eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as a three letter acronym for control z instead of substitute.
 the end of text code etx also known as control c was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid .
 a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard.
 in c library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such null terminated string s can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero .

 ascii printable characters codes two zero hex to seven e hex known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols.
 there are nine five printable characters in total.
 code two zero hex the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard.
 since the space character is considered an invisible graphic rather than a control character it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section.
 code seven f hex corresponds to the non printable delete del control character and is therefore omitted from this chart it is covered in the previous section s chart.
 earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret five e hex and the left arrow instead of the underscore five f hex .

 of these the iana encourages use of the name us ascii for internet uses of ascii even if it is a redundant acronym but the us is needed because of abuse of the ascii term .
 one often finds this in the optional charset parameter in the content type header of some mime messages in the equivalent meta element of some html documents and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some xml documents.
 variants as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets.
 one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ascii s character map in the seven bit range.
 furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii.
 many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non english letters e.
g.
 currency symbols e.
g.
 etc.
 the petscii code commodore international used for their eight bit systems is probably unique among post one nine seven zero codes in being based on ascii one nine six three instead of the more common ascii one nine six seven such as found on the zx spectrum computer.
 atari eight bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants.
 seven bit from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard ultimately published as iso iec six four six one nine seven two which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code point s reserved for national use.
 however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii one nine six three and iso s first acceptance of an international recommendation during one nine six seven caused ascii s choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.
 iso iec six four six like ascii was a seven bit character set.
 it did not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries.
 escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.
 because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec six four six a german french or swedish etc.
 programmer using their national variant of iso iec six four six rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as a i n instead of c trigraph s were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use.
 many programmers kept their computers on us ascii so plain text in swedish german etc.
 for example in e mail or usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to.
 for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get n sar.
 as the answer which should be n jag har sm rg sar.
 meaning no i ve got sandwiches.
 eight bit eventually as eight one six and three two bit and later six four bit computers began to replace one eight and three six bit computers as the norm it became common to use an eight bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended eight bit relatives of ascii.
 in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first one two eight i.
e.
 seven bit characters.
 most early home computer systems developed their own eight bit character sets containing line drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from zero three one with more graphics.
 kaypro cp m computers used the upper one two eight characters for the greek alphabet.
 the ibm pc defined code page four three seven which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper one two eight positions.
 operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pc s supported them in hardware.
 digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set dec mcs for use in the popular vt two two zero terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics.
 the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets.
 the iso iec eight eight five nine standard derived from the dec mcs finally provided a standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions .
 a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows one two five two often mislabeled as iso eight eight five nine one added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.
 iso eight eight five nine one windows one two five two and the original seven bit ascii were the most common character encodings until two zero zero eight when utf eight became more common.
 iso iec four eight seven three introduced three two additional control codes defined in the eight zero nine f hexadecimal range as part of extending the seven bit ascii encoding to become an eight bit system.
 unicode unicode and the iso iec one zero six four six universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec eight eight five nine and ascii rapidly in many environments.
 while ascii is limited to one two eight characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural number s called code points and encoding to eight one six or three two bit binary formats called utf eight utf one six and utf three two .
 to allow backward compatibility the one two eight ascii and two five six iso eight eight five nine one latin one characters are assigned unicode ucs code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards.
 therefore ascii can be considered a seven bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of unicode ucs and ascii when prefixed with zero as the eighth bit is valid utf eight .
 order ascii code order is also called asciibetical order.
 collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence .
 the main deviations in ascii order are all uppercase come before lowercase letters for example z comes before a digits and many punctuation marks come before letters for example four precedes one numbers are sorted na vely as strings for example one zero precedes two an intermediate order readily implemented converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values.
 na ve number sorting can be averted by zero filling all numbers e.
g.
 zero two will sort before one zero as expected although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.

 animated feature length films returned the highest gross margin s around five two of all film genre s in the two zero zero four two zero one three timeframe.
 techniques traditional animation an example of traditional animation a horse animated by rotoscoping from eadweard muybridge s one nine th century photos traditional animation also called cel animation or hand drawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the two zero th century.
 the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper.
 to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it.
 the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cel s which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.
 the completed character cels are photographed one by one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film.
 the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the two one st century.
 today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.
 various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.
 the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional three five mm film and newer media such as digital video .
 the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animator s work has remained essentially the same over the past seven zero years.
 some animation producers have used the term tradigital to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technologies.
 examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states one nine four zero animal farm united kingdom one nine five four and the illusionist british french two zero one zero .
 traditionally animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us one nine nine four akira japan one nine eight eight spirited away japan two zero zero one the triplets of belleville france two zero zero three and the secret of kells irish french belgian two zero zero nine .
 full animation refers to the process of producing high quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having a smooth animation.
 fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles from more realistically animated works such as those produced by the walt disney studio the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin the lion king to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros.
 animation studio .
 many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are non disney works such as the secret of nimh us one nine eight two the iron giant us one nine nine nine and nocturna spain two zero zero seven .
 limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation.
 pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboing boing us one nine five one yellow submarine uk one nine six eight and much of the anime produced in japan.
 its primary use however has been in producing cost effective animated content for media such as television the work of hanna barbera filmation and other tv animation studios and later the internet web cartoon s .
 rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in one nine one seven where animators trace live action movement frame by frame.
 the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings us one nine seven eight or used in a stylized and expressive manner as in waking life us two zero zero one and a scanner darkly us two zero zero six .
 some other examples are fire and ice us one nine eight three heavy metal one nine eight one and aku no hana two zero one three .
 live action animation is a technique combining hand drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.
 one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live action footage.
 other examples include who framed roger rabbit us one nine eight eight space jam us one nine nine six and osmosis jones us two zero zero one .
 stop motion animation stop motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.
 there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation.
 computer software is widely available to create this type of animation however traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and time consuming to produce than current computer animation.
 puppet animation typically involves stop motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment in contrast to real world interaction in model animation.
 the puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady as well as to constrain their motion to particular joints.
 examples include the tale of the fox france one nine three seven the nightmare before christmas us one nine nine three corpse bride us two zero zero five coraline us two zero zero nine the films of ji trnka and the tv series robot chicken us two zero zero five present .
 puppetoon created using techniques developed by george pal are puppet animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.
 a clay animation scene from a finnish television commercial clay animation or plasticine animation often called claymation which however is a trademark ed name uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop motion animation.
 the figures may have an armature or wire frame inside similar to the related puppet animation below that can be manipulated to pose the figures.
 alternatively the figures may be made entirely of clay such as in the films of bruce bickford where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes.
 examples of clay animated works include the gumby show us one nine five seven one nine six seven morph shorts uk one nine seven seven two zero zero zero wallace and gromit shorts uk as of one nine eight nine jan vankmajer s dimensions of dialogue czechoslovakia one nine eight two the trap door uk one nine eight four .
 films include wallace loaf of clay internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery is sliced into thin sheets with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.
 cutout animation is a type of stop motion animation produced by moving two dimensional pieces of material such as paper or cloth.
 examples include terry gilliam s animated sequences from monty python s flying circus uk one nine six nine one nine seven four fantastic planet france czechoslovakia one nine seven three tale of tales russia one nine seven nine the pilot episode of the tv series and sometimes in episodes of south park us one nine nine seven and the music video live for the moment from verona riots band produced by alberto serrano and n vola uy spain two zero one four .
 silhouette animation is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.
 examples include the adventures of prince achmed weimar republic one nine two six and princes et princesses france two zero zero zero .
 model animation refers to stop motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live action world.
 intercutting matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.
 examples include the work of ray harryhausen as seen in films such jason and the argonauts one nine six three and the work of willis h.
 o brien on films such as king kong one nine three three film .
 go motion is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film which is not present in traditional stop motion.
 the technique was invented by industrial light vermithrax from dragonslayer one nine eight one film .
 object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop motion animation as opposed to specially created items.
 graphic animation uses non drawn flat visual graphic material photographs newspaper clippings magazines etc.
 which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement.
 at other times the graphics remain stationary while the stop motion camera is moved to create on screen action.
 brickfilm a subgenre of object animation involving using lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation.
 these have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites like youtube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.
 pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters.
 this allows for a number of surreal effects including disappearances and reappearances allowing people to appear to slide across the ground and other such effects.
 examples of pixilation include the secret adventures of tom thumb and angry kid shorts.
 computer animation computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.
 two d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while three d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.
 three d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.
 two d animation a two d animation of two circles joined by a chain two d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using two d bitmap graphics or created and edited using two d vector graphics .
 this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping.
 two d animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation .
 cinemagraph s are still photograph s in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated.
 final line advection animation is a technique used in two d animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department.
 speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm.
 three d animation three d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator.
 the animator usually starts by creating a three d polygon mesh to manipulate.
 a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a three d object or three d environment.
 sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices.
 this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement.
 other techniques can be applied such as mathematical functions e.
g.
 gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects such as fire and water simulations.
 these techniques fall under the category of three d dynamics.
 three d terms cel shaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using cg software.
 shading looks stark with less blending of colors.
 examples include skyland two zero zero seven france the iron giant one nine nine nine united states futurama fox one nine nine nine appleseed ex machina two zero zero seven japan the legend of zelda the wind waker two zero zero two japan machinima films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds.
 motion capture is used when live action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into cg characters.
 examples include polar express two zero zero four us beowulf two zero zero seven us a christmas carol two zero zero nine us the adventures of tintin film two zero one one us kochadiiyan two zero one four india photo realistic animation is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin plants water fire clouds etc.
 examples include up two zero zero nine us how to train your dragon two zero one zero us ice age two zero zero two us .
 mechanical animation animatronics is the use of mechatronics to create machines which seem animate rather than robotic.
 audio animatronics and autonomatronics is a form of robotic s animation combined with three d animation created by walt disney imagineering for shows and attractions at disney theme parks move and make noise generally a recorded speech or song but are fixed to whatever supports them.
 they can sit and stand but cannot walk.
 an audio animatron is different from an android type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds rather than responding to external stimuli.
 in two zero zero nine disney created an interactive version of the technology called autonomatronics.
 linear animation generator is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft.
 the animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion parallel to the installed picture frames.
 the concept and the technical solution were invented in two zero zero seven by mihai girlovan in romania.
 chuckimation is a type of animation created by the makers of the cartoon action league now in which characters props are thrown or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands puppetry is a form of theatre or performance animation that involves the manipulation of puppets.
 it is very ancient and is believed to have originated three zero zero zero years bc.
 puppetry takes many forms but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects.
 puppetry is used in almost all human societies both as entertainment in performance and ceremonially in rituals and celebrations such as carnivals.
 most puppetry involves storytelling.
 toy story zoetrope at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using figures rather than static pictures.
 zoetrope is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures.
 the term zoetrope is from the greek words zo meaning alive active and tropos meaning turn with zoetrope taken to mean active turn or wheel of life .
 other animation styles techniques and approaches world of color hydrotechnics at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using one two zero zero fountains with high definition projections on mist screens.
 hydrotechnics a technique that includes lights water fire fog and lasers with high definition projections on mist screens.
 drawn on film animation a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock for example by norman mclaren len lye and stan brakhage .
 paint on glass animation a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paint s on sheets of glass for example by aleksandr petrov .
 erasure animation a technique using traditional two d media photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image.
 for example william kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films and piotr duma a for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.
 pinscreen animation makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen.
 the screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows.
 the technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.
 sand animation sand is moved around on a back or front lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.
 this creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light contrast .
 flip book a flip book sometimes especially in british english called a flick book is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next so that when the pages are turned rapidly the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.
 flip books are often illustrated books for children but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings.
 flip books are not always separate books but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines often in the page corners.
 software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom made flip books.
 character animation multi sketch ing special effects animation production the creation of non trivial animation works i.
e.
 longer than a few seconds has developed as a form of filmmaking but with certain unique aspects.
 one thing live action and animated feature length films do have in common is that they are both extremely labor intensive and have high production costs.
 the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is much much higher for animated films than for live action films.
 it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live action film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation .
 it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.
 thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the one nine three zero s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artist s develop every single scene through storyboard s then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole.
 while live action films are now also storyboarded they necessarily enjoy much more latitude to depart from storyboards i.
e.
 real time improvisation .
 another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger.
 animators like all artists necessarily have their own individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film.
 since the early one nine eight zero s feature length animated films have been created by teams of about five zero zero to six zero zero people of whom five zero to seven zero are animators.
 it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each other s styles but it is much harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another.
 this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins.
 character designers on the visual development team draw model sheet s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles.
 on traditionally animated projects maquette s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.
 unlike live action films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.
 in the early one nine six zero s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and such screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late one nine eight zero s.
 criticism animation has become a domineering force in media and cinema since its inception.
 with its popularity a large amount of criticism has arisen especially animated feature length films.
 many concerns of cultural representation psychological effects on children and displays of gender binaries have been brought up around the animation industry which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.
 the under representation of women has been criticised not only in animation films themselves but also the industry.
 awards as with any other form of media animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field.
 the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year one nine three two during the five th academy awards function.
 the first winner of the academy award was the short flowers and trees a production by walt disney productions and united artists .
 flowers and trees one nine three two ist oscar award winner three d animation movie free maya video tutorials however the academy award for a feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year two zero zero one and awarded during the seven four th academy awards in two zero zero two .
 it was won by the movie shrek shrek two zero zero one awards produced by dreamworks and pacific data images .
 since then disney pixar have produced the most movies either to win or be nominated for the award.
 the list of both awards can be obtained here academy award for best animated feature academy award for best animated short film several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards africa movie academy award for best animation since two zero zero eight bafta award for best animated film since two zero zero six c sar award for best animated film since two zero one one golden rooster award for best animation since one nine eight one goya award for best animated film since one nine eight nine japan academy prize for animation of the year since two zero zero seven national film award for best animated film since two zero zero six .
 also since two zero zero seven the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards .
 since two zero zero nine the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film .
 the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation.
 unlike the academy awards the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor.
 they were re organized in one nine nine two to create a new field for best animated feature.

 animation articles containing video clips apollo attic ionic and homeric greek apoll n doric apell n arcadocypriot apeil n aeolic aploun is one of the most important and complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology .
 the ideal of the kouros a beardless athletic youth apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music truth and prophecy healing the sun and light plague poetry and more.
 apollo is the son of zeus and leto and has a twin sister the chaste huntress artemis .
 apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu .
 as the patron of delphi pythian apollo apollo was an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle .
 medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius yet apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague .
 amongst the god s custodial charges apollo became associated with dominion over colonists and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.
 as the leader of the muse s apollon musegetes and director of their choir apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry.
 hermes created the lyre for him and the instrument became a common attribute of apollo .
 hymns sung to apollo were called paean s.
 in hellenistic times especially during the three rd century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios titan god of the sun and his sister artemis similarly equated with selene titan goddess of the moon .
 in latin texts on the other hand joseph fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of apollo with sol among the augustan poets of the one st century not even in the conjurations of aeneas and latinus in aeneid xii one six one two one five .
 apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the three rd century ce.
 etymology the name of apollo itself though not paean a possible name of a precursor god to or epithet of him is generally considered to be absent from the linear b mycenean greek texts although it is possible that the name is in fact attested in the lacunose form pe rjo linear b on the kn e eight four two tablet.
 the etymology of the name is uncertain.
 the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic derived from an earlier .
 it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai .
 according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square.
 apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia .
 r.
 s.
 p.
 beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a pre greek proto form apal y un .
 several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors.
 thus the greeks most often associated apollo s name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy .
 plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redeem with apolousis purification and with h aploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting .
 hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.
 in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pell n pallene .
 a number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas d is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian aplu a god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil a title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun.
 the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending a plague against the greeks the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague .
 the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric .
 a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter .
 greco roman epithets apollo like other greek deities had a number of epithet s applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the god.
 however while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth only a few occur in latin literature chief among them phoebus phoibos literally bright which was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans in apollo s role as the god of light.
 as sun god and god of light apollo was also known by the epithets aegletes aigl t s from light of the sun helius helios literally sun phanaeus phanaios literally giving or bringing light and lyceus lykeios from proto greek light .
 the meaning of the epithet lyceus later became associated with apollo s mother leto who was the patron goddess of lycia and who was identified with the wolf earning him the epithets lycegenes luk gen s literally born of a wolf or born of lycia and lycoctonus lykoktonos from wolf and to kill .
 as god of the sun the romans referred to apollo as sol literally sun in latin .
 in association with his birthplace mount cynthus on the island of delos apollo was called cynthius kunthios literally cynthian cynthogenes kynthogen s literally born of cynthus and delius delios literally delian .
 as artemis s twin apollo had the epithet didymaeus didymaios from twin .
 partial view of the temple of apollo epikurios healer at bassae in southern greece apollo was worshipped as actiacus aktiakos literally actian delphinius delphinios literally delphic and pythius puthios from pyth the area around delphi after actium and delphi respectively two of his principal places of worship.
 an etiology in the homeric hymns associated the epithet delphinius with dolphins.
 he was worshipped as acraephius akraiphios literally acraephian or acraephiaeus akraiphiaios literally acraephian in the boeotia n town of acraephia reputedly founded by his son acraepheus and as smintheus smintheus sminthian that is of the town of sminthos or sminthe near the troad town of hamaxitus .
 the epithet smintheus has historically been confused with mouse in association with apollo s role as a god of disease.

 the romans referred to apollo as articenens bow carrying .
 apollo was called ismenius ism nios literally of ismenus after ismenus the son of amphion and niobe whom he struck with an arrow.
 celtic epithets and cult titles apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire .
 in the traditionally celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god.
 he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character.

 he was a god of healing especially of the eyes.
 apollo virotutis benefactor of mankind .
 apollo virotutis was worshipped among other places at fins d annecy haute savoie and at jublains maine et loire .
 origins the omphalos in the museum of delphi the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the eight th century bce.
 the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollo s twin sister.
 at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho .
 for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods.
 in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing .
 in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.
 walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a dorian northwest greek component a cretan minoan component and a syro hittite component.
 from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection from symbols and omina semeia kai terata and of the observation of the omen s of the days.
 the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced from anatolia .
 the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning.
 the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony.
 apollo became the god of shining youth the protector of music spiritual life moderation and perceptible order.
 the improvement of the old anatolia n god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people .
 healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as a healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from a more primitive religion.
 pae n is probably connected with the mycenean pa ja wo ne linear b but this is not certain.
 he did not have a separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease.
 later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean .
 the magicians were also called seer doctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles.
 in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the terrible vedic god of disease rudra .
 he sends a terrible plague to the achaeans .
 the god who sends a disease can also prevent from it therefore when it stops they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil.
 when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with a song they call their own god the beautiful paean .
 some common epithets of apollo as a healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios help oulios healed wound also a scar and loimios plague .
 in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios divert deter avert and alexikakos from v.
 n.
 defend from evil .
 in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing .
 homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph.
 such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo s son asclepius the healer.
 about the four th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered.
 it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music.
 apollo s role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won.
 dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated one five nine one depicting apollo s first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum .
 the connection with dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars but it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone .
 stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos .
 the homeric hymn represents apollo as a northern intruder.
 his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python .
 the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.
 the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated.
 a female dragon named delphyne womb who is obviously connected with delphi and apollo delphinios and a male serpent typhon to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python .
 python was the good daemon of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as a dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east.
 apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows.
 the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology .
 in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves .
 the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals.
 the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo.
 the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva .
 rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiba is a healer physician god.
 however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult.
 minoan origin ornamented golden minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean ages.
 in historical times the priests of delphi were called labryaden the double axe men which indicates minoan origin.
 the double axe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth .
 the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices.
 apollo delphinios was a sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands and his name indicates his connection with delphi and the holy serpent delphyne womb .
 apollo s sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals .
 in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the mister of the animals a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute.
 his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more powerful apollo who stood by the mistress of the animals becoming her brother.
 the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple.
 this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition.
 in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolia n origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself.
 however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.
 plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy a greek word he connected with mantis prophet .
 frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc.
 although crete had contacts with mari from two zero zero zero bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages.
 it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece.
 anatolian origin illustration of a coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia a non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.
 the name of apollo s mother leto has lydia n origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor .
 the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines.
 omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylon ian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites .
 in a hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a babylonian priestess for a certain purification .
 a similar story is mentioned by plutarch .
 he writes that the creta n seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer s expertise in sacrifice s and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state.
 the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had a resisting religion up to the historical times.
 it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia .
 homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war .
 he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods.
 the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete.
 the stones found in front of the gates of homer ic troy were the symbols of apollo.
 the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.
 however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates a babylonia n origin.
 the late bronze age from one seven zero zero to one two zero zero bce hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague invoked during plague years.
 here we have an apotropaic situation where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it.
 aplu meaning the son of was a title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash .
 homer interprets apollo as a terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods.
 in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.
 all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo.
 oracular cult columns of the temple of apollo at delphi greece unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi .
 in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.
 apollo s cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about six five zero bce.
 apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity.
 oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites.
 in the two nd and three rd century ce those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity .
 in the three rd century apollo fell silent.
 julian the apostate three five nine six one tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed.
 oracular shrines delos lions apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae .
 his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponym ic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus .
 his oracular shrines include abae in phocis .
 bassae in the peloponnese .
 at clarus on the west coast of asia minor as at delphi a holy spring which gave off a pneuma from which the priests drank.
 in corinth the oracle of corinth came from the town of tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the trojan war.
 at khyrse in troad the temple was built for apollo smintheus.

 the hieron sanctuary of apollo adjacent to the sacred lake was the place where the god was said to have been born.
 in delphi the pythia became filled with the pneuma of apollo said to come from a spring inside the adyton .
 in didyma an oracle on the coast of anatolia south west of lydia n luwian sardis in which priests from the lineage of the branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple.
 was believed to have been founded by branchus son or lover of apollo.
 in hierapolis bambyce syria modern manbij according to the treatise de dea syria the sanctuary of the syrian goddess contained a robed and bearded image of apollo.
 divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.
 at patara in lycia there was a seasonal winter oracle of apollo said to have been the place where the god went from delos.
 as at delphi the oracle at patara was a woman.
 in segesta in sicily.
 oracles were also given by sons of apollo.
 in oropus north of athens the oracle amphiaraus was said to be the son of apollo oropus also had a sacred spring.
 in labadea east of delphi trophonius another son of apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.
 temples of apollo a lot of temples dedicated to apollo were built in greece and in the greek colonies and they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations.
 some of the earliest temples especially in crete don t belong to any greek order.
 it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures.
 the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order .
 the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances.
 the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection.
 from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings.
 the first buildings were narrow to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms.
 this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.
 the doric order dominated during the six th and the five th century b.
c but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn t be solved without changing the original forms.
 the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple.
 both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome.

 mythology birth apollo left and artemis .
 brygos potter signed tondo of an attic red figure cup c.
 four seven zero bc mus e du louvre .
 when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant and that zeus was the father she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma .
 in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor a real island.
 she gave birth there and was accepted by the people offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city.
 afterwards zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean.
 this island later became sacred to apollo.
 it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor.
 the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace nine yards eight m long of amber.
 mythographers agree that artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo.
 apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition.
 the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him.
 youth four days after his birth apollo killed the chthonic dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring .
 this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies.
 hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world.
 to protect his mother apollo begged hephaestus for a bow and arrows.
 after receiving them apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi.
 apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was a child of gaia .
 hera then sent the giant tityos to rape leto.
 this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother.
 during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus .
 there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where a pair of vulture s feasted daily on his liver.
 trojan war apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in retribution for agamemnon s insult to chryses a priest of apollo whose daughter chryseis had been captured.
 he demanded her return and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad .
 in the iliad when diomedes injured aeneas apollo rescued him.
 first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well.
 aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos a sacred spot in troy .
 apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles heel.
 one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles sacrilege in murdering troilus the god s own son by hecuba on the very altar of the god s own temple.
 admetus when zeus struck down apollo s son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead transgressing themis by stealing hades s subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus.
 apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever for this but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor due to the intercession of his mother leto .
 during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly .
 admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus.
 apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place.
 but when it came time for admetus to die his parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate.
 instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living.
 artemis and apollo piercing niobe s children with their arrows by jacques louis david dallas museum of art niobe niobe the queen of thebes and wife of amphion boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two.
 apollo killed her sons and artemis her daughters.
 apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth a number of the niobids were spared chloris usually .
 amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge.
 a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept.
 her tears formed the river achelous .
 zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them.
 consorts and children love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology.
 their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.
 female lovers apollo and daphne by bernini in the galleria borghese daphne was a nymph daughter of the river god peneus who had scorned apollo.
 the myth explains the connection of apollo with daphn the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi .
 in ovid s metamorphoses phoebus apollo chaffs cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man whereupon cupid wounds him with a golden dart simultaneously however cupid shoots a leaden arrow into daphne causing her to be repulsed by apollo.
 following a spirited chase by apollo daphne prays to her father peneus for help and he changes her into the laurel tree sacred to apollo.
 artemis daphnaia who had her temple among the lacedemonians at a place called hypsoi in antiquity on the slopes of mount cnacadion near the spartan frontier had her own sacred laurel trees.
 at eretria the identity of an excavated seven th and six th century temple to apollo daphnephoros apollo laurel bearer or carrying off daphne a place where the citizens are to take the oath is identified in inscriptions.
 leucothea was daughter of orchamus and sister of clytia .
 she fell in love with apollo who disguised himself as leucothea s mother to gain entrance to her chambers.
 clytia jealous of her sister because she wanted apollo for herself told orchamus the truth betraying her sister s trust and confidence in her.
 enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive.
 apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died.
 apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day.
 marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well.
 zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old.
 castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved.
 she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt.
 parnassos which was then named after her.
 water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.
 in the last oracle is mentioned that the water which could speak has been lost for ever.

 coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths .
 pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus .
 a crow informed apollo of the affair.
 when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as a punishment for spreading untruths.
 when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis in other stories apollo himself had killed coronis .
 as a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths.
 apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise.
 phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi.
 apollo then killed him for what he did.

 he was a sparta n prince beautiful and athletic.
 the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly.
 apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas .
 the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta.
 another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles .
 apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth.
 cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever.
 apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.
 other male lovers of apollo include admetus atymnius otherwise known as a beloved of sarpedon branchus alternately a son of apollo carnus clarus hippolytus of sicyon not the same as hippolytus hymenaios iapis leucates who threw himself off a rock when apollo attempted to carry him off phorbas probably the son of triopas potnieus apollo s lyre upright apollo with his lyre .

 hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia.
 the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes .
 his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus .
 maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep.
 hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle.
 the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks.
 in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides.
 he used one of the cow s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre .
 apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo s claim.
 zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo.
 hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented.
 apollo a god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre.
 hence apollo then became a master of the lyre.
 apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war and cassandra a prophetess of apollo.
 apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon s son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover.
 orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes furies female personifications of vengeance .
 apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage.
 they invade his temple and he says that the matter should be brought before athena.
 apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo s supplicant.
 apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo.

 tmolus the mountain god was chosen to umpire.
 pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present.
 then apollo struck the strings of his lyre.
 tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment.
 he dissented and questioned the justice of the award.
 apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey .
 marsyas upright marsyas under apollo s punishment stanbul archaeology museum apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague bringing death dealing arrows marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music.
 he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy.
 the contest was judged by the muse s.
 after they each performed both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time.
 as apollo played the lyre this was easy to do.
 marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time.
 apollo was declared the winner because of this.
 apollo flayed marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god.
 he then nailed marsyas shaggy skin to a nearby pine tree.
 marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas .
 another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down.
 marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.
 cinyras apollo also had a lyre playing contest with cinyras his son who committed suicide when he lost.

 seven five head of apollo marble roman copy of a greek original of the four th century bce from the collection of cardinal albani roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks.
 as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus .
 there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus .
 on the occasion of a pestilence in the four three zero s bce apollo s first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare .
 during the second punic war in two one two bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius.
 in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome.
 after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo s temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour.
 he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill .
 sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in one seven bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era.
 festivals the chief apollonian festivals were the boedromia carneia carpiae daphnephoria delia hyacinthia metageitnia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia .

 other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword.
 another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers.
 the pythian games were held in apollo s honor every four years at delphi .
 the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games.
 the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos .
 animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swan s cicada s symbolizing music and song hawk s raven s crow s snakes referencing apollo s function as the god of prophecy mice and griffin s mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin.
 apollo citharoedus apollo with a kithara musei capitolini rome as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization seven five zero five five zero bce.
 according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadia n colonists found the city of troy .
 however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention a minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars.
 in this interpretation apollo s title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god s supposed link with wolves possibly a folk etymology .
 in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder.
 the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian .
 however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus.
 this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase .
 apollo is often associated with the golden mean .
 this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony .
 apollo in the arts the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles three six zero bc apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance .
 the earliest greek word for a statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision.
 greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined.
 the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.
 the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity.
 the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment.
 the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.
 the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period .
 in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole a method created by polykleitos .
 finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization.
 art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras .
 thales searched for a simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism .
 this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms.
 pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation.
 the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers.
 his ideas had a great influence on post archaic art and the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection.
 canon .
 in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas .
 the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas.
 the greek words oida i know and eidos species have the same root as the word idea indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses.
 the artists in plato s time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization.
 the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual.
 archaic sculpture sacred gate kouros marble six one zero six zero zero bc kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece .
 this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo .
 the first statues are certainly still and formal.
 the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egypt ian precedent but it was accepted for a good reason.
 the sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness.
 when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods.
 the adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented.
 these forms expressed immortality.
 apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order .

 one marble six two zero six one zero bc metropolitan museum of art in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period six four zero five eight zero bc the artists tried to draw one s attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life.
 the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive.
 this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself.
 a fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros .
 the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity.
 according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move.
 it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.
 piraeus apollo archaic style bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord.
 this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.
 these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta.
 the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos .
 such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone.
 the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period five two zero four eight five bc in which the greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole.
 ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo .
 it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens.
 the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand.
 it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus .
 the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art.
 the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionia n influence in athens.
 finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later.
 classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after a five th century bce greek original attributed to polykleitos mus e du louvre in the next century which is the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions.
 the artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element.
 anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other.
 the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances.
 polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.
 it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras .
 the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm.
 the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late one st or early two nd century modelled upon a supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the five th century bce in a style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic.
 the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.
 though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone.
 the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age.
 just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of a work of art.
 spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form.
 just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same.
 artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self.
 things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.
 pediments and friezes upright apollo west pediment olympia.
 munich copy from original four six zero bce at the temple of zeus olympia greece .
 in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.
 the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling.
 the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo s tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration.

 in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene.

 apollo and artemis in the northeast corner.
 these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake.
 they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in a larger whole.
 while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs.
 in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield.
 the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.

 another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse .
 the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the three rd century bce to depict alexander the great .

 the name austroasiatic comes from the latin words for south and asia hence south asia .
 of these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have a long established recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status in vietnam and cambodia respectively .
 the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups.
 ethnologue identifies one six eight austroasiatic languages.
 these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as a fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda .
 however one recent classification posits three groups munda nuclear mon khmer and khasi khmuic while another has abandoned mon khmer as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family.
 austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across india bangladesh nepal and southeast asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken.
 they appear to be the autochthonous language s of southeast asia with the neighboring indo aryan tai kadai dravidian austronesian and sino tibetan languages being the result of later migrations.
 typology the austroasiatic languages are well known for having a sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable.
 many of them also have infix es.
 the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice .
 languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three or even four way voicing contrast.
 however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis .
 proto language much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry l.
 shorto s mon khmer comparative dictionary .
 little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented.
 with their demotion from a primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic.
 paul sidwell two zero zero five reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for .
 is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in.
 sidwell two zero one one suggests that the likely homeland of austroasiatic is the middle mekong in the area of the bahnaric and katuic languages approximately where modern laos thailand and cambodia come together and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed dating to perhaps two zero zero zero bce.
 internal classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh.
 however no evidence for this classification has ever been published.
 each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.
 by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic is debated.
 in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accept traditional mon khmer as a valid unit.
 however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.
 in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar one nine nine five .
 sidwell two zero zero nine two zero one one paul sidwell and roger blench propose that the austroasiatic phylum had dispersed via the mekong river drainage basin .
 paul sidwell two zero zero nine a in a lexicostatistical comparison of three six languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic.
 he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence.
 sidwell rongic .
 many words of austroasiatic origin have been noticed in lepcha suggesting a sino tibetan superstrate laid over an austroasiatic substrate.
 blench two zero one three calls this branch rongic based on the lepcha autonym r ng .

se rwaai rwaai repository and workspace for austroasiatic intangible heritage rwaai digital archive agglutinative languages austroasiatic languages afroasiatic afro asiatic also known as afrasian and traditionally as hamito semitic chamito semitic is a large language family of several hundred related languages and dialects.
 it comprises about three zero zero or so living languages and dialects according to the two zero zero nine ethnologue estimate.
 it includes languages spoken predominantly in the middle east north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel .
 afroasiatic languages have three five zero million native speakers the fourth largest number of any language family.
 it has six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic and semitic .
 the most widely spoken afroasiatic language is arabic including literary arabic and the spoken colloquial varieties which has around two zero zero to two three zero million native speakers concentrated primarily in the middle east and in parts of north africa.
 tamazight and other berber varieties are spoken in morocco algeria libya tunisia northern mali and northern niger by about two five to three five million people.
 other widely spoken afroasiatic languages include hausa the dominant language of northern nigeria and southern niger spoken as a first language by two five million people and used as a lingua franca by another two zero million across west africa and the sahel oromo of ethiopia and kenya with about three three million speakers total amharic of ethiopia with over two five million native speakers in addition to millions of other ethiopians speaking it as a second language somali spoken by one five .
 five million people in greater somalia modern hebrew spoken by around seven million people worldwide modern aramaic spoken by about five five zero zero zero zero people worldwide.
 this is not just one language it includes a number of subdivisions with assyrian neo aramaic being the most spoken variety two three two three zero zero .
 in addition to languages spoken today afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as ancient egyptian akkadian biblical hebrew and old aramaic .
 there is no agreement on when or where the original homeland of this language family existed.
 proposed locations include the horn of africa north africa the eastern sahara and the levant .
 etymology the afroasiatic language family was originally referred to as ham ito sem itic a term introduced in the one eight six zero s by the german scholar karl richard lepsius .
 the name was later popularized by friedrich m ller in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft vienna one eight seven six eight eight .
 the term afroasiatic often now spelled as afro asiatic was later coined by maurice delafosse one nine one four .
 however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg one nine five zero formally proposed its adoption.
 in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that afroasiatic was represented transcontinentally in both africa and asia.
 individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker one nine six six and lisramic hodge one nine seven two .
 in lieu of hamito semitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the family s constituent languages.
 the term hamito semitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries.
 distribution and branches some linguists proposals for grouping within afroasiatic the afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic semitic although there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study afroasiatic.
 in particular the omotic language branch is the most controversial member of afroasiatic because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly hayward one nine nine five .
 greenberg one nine six three and others considered it a subgroup of cushitic whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of afroasiatic at all e.
g.
 theil two zero zero six .
 the afroasiatic identity of ongota is also broadly questioned as is its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data.
 harold fleming two zero zero six proposes that ongota constitutes a separate branch of afroasiatic.
 harrassowitz verlag the harrassowitz publishing house bonny sands two zero zero nine believes the most convincing proposal is by sav and tosco two zero zero three namely that ongota is an east cushitic language with a nilo saharan substratum .
 in other words it would appear that the ongota people once spoke a nilo saharan language but then shifted to speaking a cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier nilo saharan language.
 beja is sometimes listed as a separate branch of afroasiatic but is more often included in the cushitic branch which has a high degree of internal diversity.
 whether the various branches of cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned but not their inclusion in afroasiatic itself.
 there is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non omotic branches of afroasiatic see subgrouping below .
 this situation is not unusual even among long established language families there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the indo european languages for instance.
 meroitic has been proposed as an unclassified afroasiatic language because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification.
 classification history in the nine th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic.
 he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic .
 in the course of the one nine th century europeans also began suggesting such relationships.
 in one eight four four theodor benfey suggested a language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic .
 in the same year t.
n.
 newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.
 friedrich m ller named the traditional hamito semitic family in one eight seven six in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft .
 he defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic he excluded the chadic group.
 these classifications relied in part on non linguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited see hamitic hypothesis .
 leo reinisch one nine zero nine proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging a more distant affinity to egyptian and semitic thus foreshadowing greenberg but his suggestion found little resonance.
 marcel cohen one nine two four rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa a chadic language in his comparative hamito semitic vocabulary.
 joseph greenberg one nine five zero strongly confirmed cohen s rejection of hamitic added and sub classified the chadic branch and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family.
 nearly all scholars have accepted greenberg s classification.
 in one nine six nine harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic .
 this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.
 several scholars including harold fleming and robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic.
 glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge and so splits off the following groups as small families south omotic mao dizoid gonga gimojan north omotic apart from the preceding ongota kujarge .
 subgrouping little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic egyptian berber chadic cushitic and omotic.
 however christopher ehret one nine seven nine harold fleming one nine eight one and joseph greenberg one nine eight one all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first.
 otherwise paul newman one nine eight zero groups berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic while questioning the inclusion of omotic in afroasiatic.
 rolf theil two zero zero six concurs with the exclusion of omotic but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.
 harold fleming one nine eight one divides non omotic afroasiatic or erythraean into three groups cushitic semitic and chadic berber egyptian.
 he later added semitic and beja to chadic berber egyptian and tentatively proposed ongota as a new third branch of erythraean.
 he thus divided afroasiatic into two major branches omotic and erythraean with erythraean consisting of three sub branches cushitic chadic berber egyptian semitic beja and ongota.
 like harold fleming christopher ehret one nine nine five four nine zero divides afroasiatic into two branches omotic and erythrean.
 he divides omotic into two branches north omotic and south omotic.
 he divides erythrean into cushitic comprising beja agaw and east south cushitic and north erythrean comprising chadic and boreafrasian.
 according to his classification boreafrasian consists of egyptian berber and semitic.
 vladimir orel and olga stolbova one nine nine five group berber with semitic and chadic with egyptian.
 they split up cushitic into five or more independent branches of afroasiatic viewing cushitic as a sprachbund rather than a language family .
 igor m.
 diakonoff one nine nine six subdivides afroasiatic in two grouping berber cushitic and semitic together as east west afrasian esa and chadic with egyptian as north south afrasian nsa .
 he excludes omotic from afroasiatic.
 lionel bender one nine nine seven groups berber cushitic and semitic together as macro cushitic .
 he regards chadic and omotic as the branches of afroasiatic most remote from the others.
 alexander militarev two zero zero zero on the basis of lexicostatistics groups berber with chadic and both more distantly with semitic as against cushitic and omotic.
 he places ongota in south omotic.
 position among the world s languages afroasiatic is one of the four language families of africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa one nine six three .
 it is the only one that extends outside of africa via the semitic branch.
 there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family.
 however several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made.
 the best known of these are the following hermann m ller one nine zero six argued for a relation between semitic and the indo european languages .
 this proposal was accepted by some linguists e.
g.
 holger pedersen and louis hjelmslev but has little currency today.
 for a fuller account see indo semitic languages .
 apparently influenced by m ller a colleague of his at the university of copenhagen holger pedersen included hamito semitic the term replaced by afroasiatic in his proposed nostratic macro family cf.
 pedersen one nine three one three three six three three eight which also included the indo european finno ugric samoyed turkish mongolian manchu yukaghir languages and dravidian languages .
 this inclusion was retained by subsequent nostraticists starting with vladislav illich svitych and aharon dolgopolsky .
 joseph greenberg two zero zero zero two zero zero two did not reject a relationship of afroasiatic to these other languages but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro family which he called eurasiatic and to which he added chukotian gilyak korean japanese ryukyuan eskimo aleut and ainu .
 most recently sergei starostin s school has accepted eurasiatic as a subgroup of nostratic with afroasiatic dravidian and kartvelian in nostratic outside of eurasiatic.
 an even larger borean group would contain nostratic as well as den caucasian and austric .
 date of afroasiatic the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription of c.
 three four zero zero bc five four zero zero years ago .
 earliest egyptian glyphs symbols on gerzean pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c.
 four zero zero zero bc suggesting a still earlier possible date.
 this gives us a minimum date for the age of afroasiatic.
 however ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto afroasiatic trombetti one nine zero five one two and considerable time must have elapsed in between them.
 estimates of the date at which the proto afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely.
 they fall within a range between approximately seven five zero zero bc nine five zero zero years ago and approximately one six zero zero zero bc one eight zero zero zero years ago .
 according to igor m.
 diakonoff one nine eight eight three three n proto afroasiatic was spoken c.
 one zero zero zero zero bc.
 according to christopher ehret two zero zero two three five three six proto afroasiatic was spoken c.
 one one zero zero zero bc at the latest and possibly as early as c.
 one six zero zero zero bc.
 these dates are older than dates associated with most other proto languages.
 afroasiatic urheimat upright map showing one of the proposed afroasiatic urheimat.
 the term afroasiatic urheimat urheimat meaning original homeland in german refers to the hypothetical place where proto afroasiatic speakers lived in a single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages.
 afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in the middle east north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel.
 their distribution seems to have been influenced by the saharan pump operating over the last one zero zero zero zero years.
 similarities in grammar and syntax widespread though not universal features of the afroasiatic languages include a set of emphatic consonant s variously realized as glottalized pharyngealized or implosive.

 semitic berber cushitic including beja and chadic support possessive suffix es.
 morphology in which words inflect by changes within the root vowel changes or gemination as well as with prefixes and suffixes.
 one of the most remarkable shared features among the afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation see table above with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with t n y and in particular a pattern whereby third singular masculine y is opposed to third singular feminine and second singular t .
 according to ehret one nine nine six tonal language s appear in the omotic and chadic branches of afroasiatic as well as in certain cushitic languages.
 the semitic berber and egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically .

d.
 one two seven eight .
 it is known as a principality as it is a monarchy headed by two co princes the spanish roman catholic bishop of urgell and the president of france .
 andorra is the sixth smallest nation in europe having an area of four six eight km two one eight one sq mi and a population of approximately eight five zero zero zero .
 its capital andorra la vella is the highest capital city in europe at an elevation of one zero two three metres three three five six ft above sea level .
 the official language is catalan although spanish portuguese and french are also commonly spoken.

 it is not a member of the european union but the euro is the de facto currency.
 it has been a member of the united nations since one nine nine three .
 in two zero one three the people of andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at eight one years according to the lancet .
 etymology the origin of the word andorra is unknown although several theories have been formulated.
 the oldest derivation of the word andorra is from the greek historian polybius the histories iii three five one who describes the andosins an iberian pre roman tribe as historically located in the valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars .
 the word andosini or andosins a may derive from the basque handia whose meaning is big or giant .
 the andorran toponymy shows evidence of basque language in the area.
 another theory suggests that the word andorra may derive from the old word anorra that contains the basque word ur water .
 one theory suggests that andorra may derive from arabic al darra meaning the pearl .
 when the moors invaded the iberian peninsula the valleys of the pyrenees were formed by large tracts of forest and other regions and towns also dominated by muslims received this designation.
 other theories suggest that the term derives from the navarro aragonese andurrial which means land covered with bushes or scrubland .
 the folk etymology holds that charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the biblical canaanite valley of endor or andor where the midianites had been defeated a name also bestowed by their heir and son louis le debonnaire after defeating the moors in the wild valleys of hell .
 history sant joan de caselles church dating from the one one th century.
 tradition holds that charles the great charlemagne granted a charter to the andorran people in return for fighting against the moors .
 overlordship of the territory was by the count of urgell and eventually by the bishop of the diocese of urgell .
 in nine eight eight borrell ii count of urgell gave the andorran valleys to the diocese of urgell in exchange for land in cerdanya .
 since then the bishop of urgell based in seu d urgell has owned andorra.
 before one zero nine five andorra did not have any type of military protection and the bishop of urgell who knew that the count of urgell wanted to reclaim the andorran valleys asked for help and protection from the lord of caboet .
 in one zero nine five the lord of caboet and the bishop of urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co sovereignty over andorra.
 arnalda daughter of arnau of caboet married the viscount of castellb and both became viscounts of castellb and cerdanya.
 years later their daughter ermessenda married roger bernat ii the french count of foix .
 they became roger bernat ii and ermessenda i counts of foix viscounts of castellb and cerdanya and co sovereigns of andorra shared with the bishop of urgell .
 in the one three th century a dispute arose between the bishop of urgell and the count of foix.
 the conflict was resolved in one two seven eight with the mediation of aragon by the signing of the first par age which provided that andorra s sovereignty be shared between the count of foix whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state and the bishop of urgell in catalonia .
 this gave the principality its territory and political form.
 with the passage of time the co title to andorra passed to the kings of navarre .
 after henry of navarre became king henry iv of france he issued an edict in one six zero seven that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co princes of andorra.
 in one eight one two one three the first french empire annexed catalonia and divided it in four d partement s with andorra being made part of the district of puigcerd d partement of s gre .
 one seven th to one nine th centuries andorra retained its medieval institutions and rural culture largely unchanged during this period.
 in one eight six six a council general of two four members elected by suffrage limited to heads of family replaced the aristocratic oligarchy previously ruling the state.
 two zero th century boris skossyreff briefly self proclaimed king of andorra in one nine three four .
 andorra declared war on imperial germany during world war i but did not actually take part in the fighting.
 it remained in an official state of belligerency until one nine five eight as it was not included in the treaty of versailles .
 in one nine three three france occupied andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections.
 on one two july one nine three four adventurer boris skossyreff issued a proclamation in urgell declaring himself boris i king of andorra simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of urgell.
 he was arrested by the spanish authorities on two zero july and ultimately expelled from spain.
 from one nine three six until one nine four zero a french military detachment was garrisoned in andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the spanish civil war and francoist spain .
 francoist troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war.
 during world war ii andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and spain.
 given its relative isolation andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history with few ties to countries other than france spain and portugal.
 in recent times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation.
 its political system was modernised in one nine nine three when it became a member of the united nations and the council of europe .
 politics andorra is a parliamentary co principality with the president of france and the bishop of urgell catalonia spain as co princes .
 this peculiarity makes the president of france in his capacity as prince of andorra an elected reigning monarch although he is not elected by a popular vote of the andorran people.
 the politics of andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy whereby the head of government is the chief executive and of a multi party system.
 the current head of government is antoni mart of the democrats for andorra da .
 executive power is exercised by the government.
 legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.
 the parliament of andorra is known as the general council.
 the general council consists of between two eight and four two councillors as the members of the legislative branch are called.
 the councillors serve for four year terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous council.
 the councillors can be elected on two equal constituencies.
 half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the councillors are elected from a single national constituency.
 one five days after the election the councillors hold their inauguration.
 during this session the syndic general who is the head of the general council and the subsyndic general his assistant are elected.
 eight days later the council convenes once more.
 during this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors.
 casa de la vall andorran parliament candidates for the nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one fifth of the councillors.
 the council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government.
 the syndic general then notifies the co princes who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of andorra.
 the general council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws.
 bills may be presented to the council as private members bills by three of the local parish councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of andorra.
 the council also approves the annual budget of the principality.
 the government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires.
 if the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved.
 once any bill is approved the syndic general is responsible for presenting it to the co princes so that they may sign and enact it.
 if the head of government is not satisfied with the council he may request that the co princes dissolve the council and order new elections.
 in turn the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office.
 after a motion of censure is approved by at least one fifth of the councillors the council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes the head of government is removed.
 law and criminal justice the judiciary is composed of the magistrates court the criminal law court the high court of andorra and the constitutional court.
 the high court of justice is composed of five judges one appointed by the head of government one each by the co princes one by the syndic general and one by the judges and magistrates.
 it is presided over by the member appointed by the syndic general and the judges hold office for six year terms.
 the magistrates and judges are appointed by the high court as is the president of the criminal law court.
 the high court also appoints members of the office of the attorney general.
 the constitutional court is responsible for interpreting the constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties.
 it is composed of four judges one appointed by each of the co princes and two by the general council.
 they serve eight year terms.
 the court is presided over by one of the judges on a two year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the court.
 foreign relations defence and security the embassy of andorra in brussels .
 andorra does not have its own armed forces although there is a small ceremonial army.
 responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with france and spain.
 however in case of emergencies or natural disasters the sometent an alarm is called and all able bodied men between two one and six zero of andorran nationality must serve.
 this is why all andorrans and especially the head of each house usually the eldest able bodied man of a house should by law keep a rifle even though the law also states that the police will offer a fire arm in case of need.
 andorra is a full member of the united nations un the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and has a special agreement with the european union eu .
 military andorra has a small army which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army.
 the basic principle of andorran defence is that all able bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the sometent .
 being a landlocked country andorra has no navy .
 prior to world war i andorra maintained an armed force of about six zero zero part time militiamen.
 this body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials viguiers appointed by france and the bishop of urgel.
 in the modern era the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.
 uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities.
 despite not being involved in any fighting andorra was technically the longest combatant in the first world war as the country was left out of the versailles peace conference and would have technically remained at war with germany from one nine one four until one nine five eight if it weren t for the small country finding itself involved in two world wars at once and thereafter signing a peace treaty with germany on september two five one nine three nine .
 this document brought peace to the andorrans for the first time in four four years and officially ended the first world war.
 the army s role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the police corps of andorra in one nine three one .
 brief civil disorder associated with the elections of one nine three three led to assistance being sought from the french national gendarmerie with a detachment resident in andorra for two months under the command of ren jules baulard.
 the andorran army was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles.
 the force consisted of six corporal s one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until one nine seven eight plus four junior staff officers to co ordinate action and a commander with the rank of major.
 it was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able bodied men of the parish.
 today a small twelve man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the andorran army but all able bodied men remain technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm.
 the army has not fought for more than seven zero zero years and its main responsibility is to present the flag of andorra at official ceremonial functions.
 according to marc forn moln andorra s military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of full time voluntaries.
 the myth that all members of the andorran army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference.
 in reality all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers or non commissioned officer s because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able bodied male population who may still be called upon by the sometent to serve although such a call has not been made in modern times.
 gipa the grup d intervenci policia d andorra gipa is a small special forces unit trained in counter terrorism and hostage recovery tasks.
 although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the police corps and not the army .
 as terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing.
 police corps andorra maintains a small but modern and well equipped internal police force with around two four zero police officers supported by civilian assistants.
 the principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing criminal detection border control and traffic policing.
 there are also small specialist units including police dogs mountain rescue and bomb disposal.
 fire brigade the andorran fire brigade with headquarters at santa coloma operates from four modern fire stations and has a staff of around one two zero firefighters.
 the service is equipped with one six heavy appliances fire tenders turntable ladders and specialist four wheel drive vehicles four light support vehicles cars and vans and four ambulances.
 historically the families of the six ancient parishes of andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires.
 the first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in one nine four three .
 the serious fires which lasted for two days in parts of the principality in december one nine five nine led to calls for a permanent fire service and the andorran fire brigade was formed on two one april one nine six one .
 the fire service maintains full time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigade s headquarters in santa coloma and one crew at each of the other three fire stations.

 andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins beginning in two zero one four .
 andorra has traditionally had one of the world s lowest unemployment rates.
 in two zero zero nine it stood at two .

 andorra has long benefited from its status as a tax haven with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs.
 however during the european sovereign debt crisis of the two one st century its tourist economy suffered a decline partly caused by a drop in the prices of goods in spain which undercut andorran duty free shop ping.
 this led to a growth in unemployment.
 on one january two zero one two a business tax of one zero was introduced followed by a sales tax of two a year later which raised just over one four million euros in its first quarter.
 on three one may two zero one three it was announced that andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of june against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among eu members.
 the announcement was made following a meeting in paris between the head of government antoni marti and the french president and prince of andorra fran ois hollande .
 hollande welcomed the move as part of a process of andorra bringing its taxation in line with international standards .

 it funds a commission for catalan toponymy in andorra catalan la comissi de topon mia d andorra and provides free catalan classes to assist immigrants.
 andorran television and radio stations use catalan.
 because of immigration historical links and close geographic proximity spanish portuguese and french are also commonly spoken.
 most andorran residents can speak one or more of these in addition to catalan.
 english is less commonly spoken among the general population though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts.

 the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or a set of results from a survey .
 the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other mean s such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean .
 in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics sociology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent.
 for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation s population.
 while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not a robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outlier s values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values .
 notably for skewed distribution s such as the distribution of income for which a few people s incomes are substantially greater than most people s the arithmetic mean may not accord with one s notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may be a better description of central tendency.
 in a more obscure usage any sequence of values that form an arithmetic sequence between two numbers x and y can be called arithmetic means between x and y .
 definition the arithmetic mean or mean or average is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency.
 in statistics the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency.
 the arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations.
 symbolically if we have a data set containing the values a one ldots a n.
 the arithmetic mean a is defined by the formula a frac sum a i .
 see summation for an explanation of the summation operator .
 for example let us consider the monthly salary of one zero employees of a firm two five zero zero two seven zero zero two four zero zero two three zero zero two five five zero two six five zero two seven five zero two four five zero two six zero zero two four zero zero .
 the arithmetic mean is frac two five three zero .
 if the data set is a statistical population i.
e.
 consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them then the mean of that population is called the population mean .
 if the data set is a statistical sample a subset of the population we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean .
 the arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar for example as in bar read x bar which is the mean of the n values x one x two ldots x n .
 motivating properties the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful especially as a measure of central tendency.
 these include if numbers x one dotsc x n have mean bar then x one bar dotsb x n bar zero .
 since x i bar is the distance from a given number to the mean one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean.
 the mean is the only single number for which the residuals deviations from the estimate sum to zero.
 if it is required to use a single number as a typical value for a set of known numbers x one dotsc x n then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value the sum of x i bar two .
 it follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error .
 if the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired then the estimate of it that is unbiased is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.
 contrast with median the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median.
 the median is defined such that half the values are larger than and half are smaller than the median.
 if elements in the sample data increase arithmetically when placed in some order then the median and arithmetic average are equal.
 for example consider the data sample .
 the average is two .
 five as is the median.
 however when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically such as the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly.
 in this case the arithmetic average is six .
 two and the median is four .
 in general the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most of them.
 there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields.
 for example since the one nine eight zero s the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.
 generalizations weighted average a weighted average or weighted mean is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation.
 for example the arithmetic mean of three and five is frac four or equivalently left frac cdot three right left frac cdot five right four .
 in contrast a weighted mean in which the first number receives for example twice as much weight as the second perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled would be calculated as left frac cdot three right left frac cdot five right frac .
 here the weights which necessarily sum to the value one are two three and one three the former being twice the latter.
 note that the arithmetic mean sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other equal to frac in the above example and equal to frac in a situation with n numbers being averaged .
 continuous probability distributions comparison of mean median and mode of two log normal distribution s with different skewness .
 when a population of numbers and any sample of data from it could take on any of a continuous range of numbers instead of for example just integers then the probability of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values even if the lengths of both ranges are the same.
 in such a case the set of probabilities can be described using a continuous probability distribution .
 the analog of a weighted average in this context in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable is called the mean of the probability distribution .
 the most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution it has the property that all measures of its central tendency including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode are equal to each other.
 this property does not hold however in the cases of a great many probability distributions such as the lognormal distribution illustrated here.
 angles particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or angle s.
 na vely taking the arithmetic mean of one and three five nine yields a result of one eight zero .
 this is incorrect for two reasons firstly angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of three six zero or two if measuring in radian s .
 thus one could as easily call these one and one or three six one and seven one nine each of which gives a different average.
 secondly in this situation zero equivalently three six zero is geometrically a better average value there is lower dispersion about it the points are both one from it and one seven nine from one eight zero the putative average .
 in general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range.
 a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation viz.
 define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion and redefine the difference as a modular distance i.
e.

 in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference three nfl teams that predated the afl s launch the cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers and the then baltimore colts joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc.
 the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact while the century division in which the browns and the steelers had played since one nine six seven was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central.

 notes national football league american football league organizations established in one nine seven zero animal farm is an allegorical and dystopian novella by george orwell first published in england on one seven august one nine four five .
 according to orwell the book reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of one nine one seven and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union .
 orwell a democratic socialist was a critic of joseph stalin and hostile to moscow directed stalinism an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the spanish civil war .
 the soviet union he believed had become a brutal dictatorship built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror .
 in a letter to yvonne davet orwell described animal farm as a satirical tale against stalin un conte satirique contre staline and in his essay why i write one nine four six wrote that animal farm was the first book in which he tried with full consciousness of what he was doing to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole .
 the original title was animal farm a fairy story u.
s.
 publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in one nine four six and only one of the translations during orwell s lifetime kept it.
 other titular variations include subtitles like a satire and a contemporary satire .
 orwell suggested the title union des r publiques socialistes animales for the french translation which abbreviates to ursa the latin for bear a symbol of russia which also played on the french name of the soviet union union des r publiques socialistes sovi tiques .
 orwell wrote the book between november one nine four three and february one nine four four when the uk was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union and the british people and intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem a phenomenon orwell hated.
 the manuscript was initially rejected by a number of british and american publishers including one of orwell s own victor gollancz which delayed its publication.
 it became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war .
 time magazine chose the book as one of the one zero zero best english language novels one nine two three to two zero zero five it also featured at number three one on the modern library list of best two zero th century novels .
 it won a retrospective hugo award in one nine nine six and is also included in the great books of the western world selection.

 composition and publication origin george orwell wrote the manuscript in one nine four three and one nine four four subsequent to his experiences during the spanish civil war which he described in homage to catalonia one nine three eight .
 in the preface of a one nine four seven ukrainian edition of animal farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries .
 this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals.
 immediately prior to his writing orwell had quit the bbc .
 he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out.
 the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination.
 in the preface orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm efforts to find a publisher orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain the united states and the soviet union.
 four publishers refused one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information .
 eventually secker and warburg published the first edition in one nine four five .
 during the second world war it became clear to orwell that anti soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch including his regular publisher gollancz .
 he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber where the poet t.
 s.
 eliot who was a director of the firm rejected it eliot wrote back to orwell praising the book s good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which i take to be generally trotskyite .
 eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm he posited that someone might argue what was needed.
.
 was not more communism but more public spirited pigs .
 orwell let andr deutsch who was working for nicholson however they did not and lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm .
 in his london letter on one seven april one nine four four for partisan review orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti russian printed.
 anti russian books do appear but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.
 the publisher jonathan cape who had initially accepted animal farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy.
 writing to leonard moore a partner in the literary agency of christy a good time with animal farm an excellent bit of satire it would illustrate perfectly.
 nothing came of this and a trial issue produced by secker the freedom of the press and bernard crick published it together with his own introduction in the times literary supplement on one five september one nine seven two as how the essay came to be written .
 orwell s essay criticised british self censorship by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government.
 the same essay also appeared in the italian one nine seven six edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface.
 other publishers were still declining to publish it.
 critical response contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive.
 writing in the american new republic magazine george soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me.
 it seemed on the whole dull.
 the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.
 soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations and said it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well .
 tosco fyvel writing in tribune two four august one nine four five called the book a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.
 julian symons responded on seven september should we not expect in tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state soviet russia it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin and snowball with trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon a political ground.
 in a hundred years time perhaps animal farm may be simply a fairy story today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.
 animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.
 analysis animalism the pigs snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old major s ideas into a complete system of thought which they formally name animalism an allegoric reference to communism .
 soon after napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments.
 squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet government s revising of history in order to exercise control of the people s beliefs about themselves and their society.
 squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the seven commandments were written ch.
 viii preliminary artwork for a one nine five zero strip cartoon by norman pett and donald freeman the original commandments are whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
 whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a friend.
 no animal shall wear clothes.
 no animal shall sleep in a bed.
 no animal shall drink alcohol.
 no animal shall kill any other animal.
 all animals are equal.
 these commandments are also distilled into the maxim four legs good two legs bad which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism.
 later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law breaking.
 the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets.
 no animal shall drink alcohol to excess.
 no animal shall kill any other animal without cause.
 eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more human.
 this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits.
 through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda .
 significance and allegory the horn and hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the hammer and sickle the communist symbol.
 in the eastern bloc both animal farm and later nineteen eighty four were on the list of forbidden books until the end of communism in one nine eight nine and were only available via clandestine samizdat networks.
 orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.
 orwell himself wrote in one nine four six of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution.
.
 and that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously power hungry people can only lead to a change of masters revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.
 in a preface for a one nine four seven ukrainian edition he stated .
.
.
 for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement.
 on my return from spain in one nine three seven i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.
 the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwell s analogy with the october one nine one seven bolshevik revolution and jones s attempt to regain control with the aid of neighbouring farmers parallels the western powers efforts of one nine one eight two one to crush the bolsheviks.
 the pigs rise to pre eminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr just as napoleon s emergence as the farm s sole leader reflects stalin s emergence.
 the pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left wing one nine two one kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans .
 the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the one nine three zero s.
 in chapter seven when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and show trials of the late one nine three zero s.
 these contributed to orwell s conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten.
 peter edgerly firchow and peter davison consider that the battle of the windmill represents the great patriotic war world war ii especially the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow .
 during the battle orwell first wrote all the animals including napoleon took cover.
 orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of stalin s decision to remain in moscow during the german advance.
 orwell requested the change after he met joseph czapski in paris in march one nine four five .
 czapski a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime told orwell as orwell wrote to arthur koestler that it had been the character and greatness of stalin that saved russia from the german invasion.
 the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in one nine one eight and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war .
 front row left to right rykov skrypnyk and stalin when snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep ch.
 v just as in the party congress in one nine two seven above at stalin s instigation pleas for the opposition were drowned in the continual hysterically intolerant uproar from the floor .
 other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwell s telescoping of russian history from one nine one seven to one nine four three include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and in germany ch iv the conflict between napoleon and snowball ch v paralleling the two rival and quasi messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west and stalinism with its glorification of russia s socialist destiny napoleon s dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ch vi paralleling the treaty of rapallo and frederick s bank notes paralleling the hitler stalin non aggression pact of august one nine three nine which are forgeries.
 frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill.
 the book s close with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement reflected orwell s view of the one nine four three teheran conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the ussr and the west but in reality were destined as orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel.
 the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington both suspicious played an ace of spades simultaneously .
 adaptations a bbc radio version produced by rayner heppenstall was broadcast in january one nine four seven .
 orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square in london with hugh gordon porteous amongst others.
 orwell later wrote to heppenstall that porteous who had not read the book grasped what was happening after a few minutes.
 a further radio production again using orwell s own dramatisation of the book was broadcast in january two zero one three on bbc radio four .
 tamsin greig narrated and the cast included nicky henson as napoleon toby jones as the propagandist squealer and ralph ineson as boxer.
 animal farm has been adapted to film twice.
 the one nine five four animal farm film was an animated feature and the one nine nine nine animal farm film was a tv live action version.
 both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties including sanitising some aspects.
 in the one nine five four version napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution.
 the one nine nine nine film shows napoleon s regime collapsing in on itself with the farm having new human owners reflecting the collapse of soviet communism appropriating the new political reality to the story.

 modern amphibians are all lissamphibia .
 they inhabit a wide variety of habitat s with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystem s.
 amphibians typically start out as larva e living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.
 the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air breathing form with lungs.
 amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamander s and frog s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin.
 they are superficially similar to reptile s but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniote s and do not require water bodies in which to breed.
 with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicator s and in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.
 the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony limbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land.
 they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates.
 over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia .
 the three modern orders of amphibians are anura the frogs and toads urodela the salamanders and apoda the caecilians .
 the number of known amphibian species is approximately seven zero zero zero of which nearly nine zero are frogs.
 the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with a length of just .
 the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil.
 the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology .

 dime which is one seven .
 nine mm in diameter for scale the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term amph bios which means both kinds of life meaning of both kinds and meaning life .
 the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters.
 traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes.
 amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct subclass temnospondyli diverse paleozoic and early mesozoic grade subclass lepospondyli small paleozoic group which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than lissamphibia subclass lissamphibia all modern amphibians including frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians salientia frog s toad s and relatives jurassic to present six two zero zero current species in five three families caudata salamander s newt s and relatives jurassic to present six five two current species in nine families gymnophiona caecilian s and relatives jurassic to present one nine two current species in one zero families alt triadobatrachus massinoti triadobatrachus massinoti a proto frog from the early triassic of madagascar the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed.
 the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world .
 the numbers of species cited above follow frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over seven zero zero zero of which nearly nine zero are frogs.
 with the phylogenetic classification the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics .
 classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem based or a node based classification.
 traditionally amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia.
 the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes.
 this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy .
 if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes a paraphyletic group.
 all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered a clade a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor.
 the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians .
 it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a temnospondyl like ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes.
 although the fossils of several older proto frogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona.
 it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs.
 the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia and is also from arizona.
 the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china.
 authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a sub order of the order salientia.
 the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamander like family the albanerpetontidae is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia.
 furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto frog triadobatrachus .
 evolutionary history the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around three seven zero million years ago from lobe finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish .
 these ancient lobe finned fish had evolved multi jointed leg like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom.
 some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen.
 they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required.
 eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapod s including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammal s.
 despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water.
 they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills.
 many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered.
 ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs.
 it had four sturdy limbs a neck a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe finned fish eusthenopteron .
 amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods.
 their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on land.
 .
 they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation.
 the fish s hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land.
 an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra occipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom.
 upright alt diplocaulus the permian lepospondyl diplocaulus was largely aquatic at the end of the devonian period three six zero million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water.
 it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal .
 in the early carboniferous three six zero to three four five million years ago the climate became wet and warm.
 extensive swamps developed with moss es fern s horsetail s and calamites .
 air breathing arthropod s evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment.
 there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile.
 though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had a long tapering body and strong tail.
 they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water.
 they still needed to return to water to lay their shell less eggs and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors.
 it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.
 after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the permian triassic extinction event .
 during the triassic period two five zero to two zero zero million years ago the reptiles continued to out compete the amphibians leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere .
 according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic.
 the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests a late carboniferous early permian origin for extant amphibians.
 alt eryops the temnospondyl eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on land the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate.
 a two zero zero five molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs.
 it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around two five zero million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe finned fish.
 the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.
 there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of a proto frog from the early permian in texas in two zero zero eight provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.
 molecular analysis suggests that the frog salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates.
 as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion.
 in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required.
 their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding.
 terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air.
 they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature.
 they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment.
 their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water.
 the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.
 characteristics the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs.
 reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious.
 lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage.
 they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps.
 on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.
 the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in two zero one two .
 it has an average length of and is part of a genus that contains four of the world s ten smallest frog species.
 the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed the extinct prionosuchus a crocodile like temnospondyl dating to two seven zero million years ago from the middle permian of brazil.
 the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh .
 amphibians are ectothermic cold blooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes.
 their metabolic rate is low and as a result their food and energy requirements are limited.
 in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations.
 they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded.
 modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes .
 their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae.
 their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified.
 their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from a few fish like scales in certain caecilians.
 the skin contains many mucous gland s and in some species poison glands.
 the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle .
 they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea .
 most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults.
 amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils.
 these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.
 they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.
 anura alt red eyed tree frog red eyed tree frog agalychnis callidryas with limbs and feet specialised for climbing the order anura from the ancient greek a n meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads.
 they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin.
 members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with skins are known as toads.
 the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule.
 members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads .
 frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in two zero one two which is also the smallest known vertebrate.
 although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts.
 they are found worldwide except for polar areas.
 anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear.
 future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships.
 the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs.
 these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages.
 the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae .
 these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders.
 neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species.
 nine six of the over five zero zero zero extant species of frog are neobatrachians.
 caudata upright alt japanese giant salamander japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus a primitive salamander the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanders elongated low slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form.
 this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals.
 salamanders lack claws have scale free skins either smooth or covered with tubercle s and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned.
 they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to a length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length.
 salamanders have a mostly laurasia n distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere.
 the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene two three million years ago.
 urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders.
 members of several families of salamanders have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults.
 most salamanders are under long.
 they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat.
 when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates.
 alt danube crested newt danube crested newt triturus dobrogicus an advanced salamander the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders.
 a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america.
 these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded.
 a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right.
 the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them.
 as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface.
 the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders.
 they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation.
 in salamandrids the male deposits a bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid.
 the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes six zero of all salamander species.
 the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae .
 the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in a single family sirenidae .
 members of this order are eel like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs.
 some of their features are primitive while others are derived.
 fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermatheca e for sperm storage.
 despite this the eggs are laid singly a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.
 gymnophiona alt siphonops paulensis the limbless south american caecilian siphonops paulensis the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda from the latin an meaning without and the greek poda meaning legs comprises the caecilians.
 these are long cylindrical limbless animals with a snake or worm like form.
 the adults vary in length from eight to seven five centimetres three to three zero inches with the exception of thomson s caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach .
 a caecilian s skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales.
 it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity.
 it also has a pair of short tentacle s near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions.
 most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic.
 most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water.
 others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch.
 a few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct.
 caecilians have a mostly gondwana n distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america.
 anatomy and physiology skin upright alt common reed frog the bright colours of the common reed frog hyperolius viridiflavus are typical of a toxic species the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands.
 local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads.
 the outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes.
 amphibians often eat the sloughed skin.
 caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin.
 the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial.
 lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderm s forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.
 cross section of frog skin.
 a mucus gland b chromatophore c granular poison gland d connective tissue e stratum corneum f transition zone g epidermis h dermis amphibian skin is permeable to water.
 gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds.
 to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails.
 the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist.
 in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances.
 some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect.
 the main poison producing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.
 the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophore s.
 these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing a blue green colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer .
 the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormone s secreted by the pituitary gland.
 unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish.
 a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.
 skeletal system and locomotion amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with a number of variations.
 they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs.
 the bones are hollow and lightweight.
 the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body.
 the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes.
 the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the well developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs.
 the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.
 alt frog skeleton skeleton of surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either.
 some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiuma s are eel like in appearance with tiny stubby legs.
 the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs.
 the caecilians are limbless.
 they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body.
 on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.
 in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming.
 in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies.
 the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil .
 in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body.
 locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop particularly when climbing.
 in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobe finned fish.
 some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails.
 in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion.
 adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.
 salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy .
 certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily.
 the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape.
 both tails and limbs can be regenerated.
 adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.
 circulatory system juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish.
 one internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated two point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins three two chambered heart.
 red indicates oxygenated blood and blue represents oxygen depleted blood.
 amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct.
 in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of a fish the two chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated around the body and back to the heart in a single loop.
 in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs.
 they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria.
 when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs.
 continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body.
 mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.
 nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with a central brain a spinal cord and nerves throughout the body.
 the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish.
 it consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum .
 various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning.
 the cerebellum is the centre of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration.
 the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body.
 the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians.
 tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians.
 some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water.
 the ears are well developed in frogs.
 there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye.
 this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone the stapes to the inner ear.
 only high frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but low frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.
 there is a patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds.
 another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columella operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals.
 the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.
 the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more dome shaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelid s and associated glands and ducts develop.
 the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes.
 they allow colour vision and depth of focus.
 in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.
 digestive and excretory systems alt dissected frog dissected frog one right atrium two liver three aorta four egg mass five colon six left atrium seven ventricle eight stomach nine left lung one zero gallbladder one one small intestine one two cloaca many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws.
 some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia .
 most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs.
 the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage.
 the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitin ous cuticle of arthropod prey.
 amphibians possess a pancreas liver and gall bladder .
 the liver is usually large with two lobes.
 its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up.
 adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail.
 omitting this until a more reliable source can be found.
 there are two kidney s located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity.
 their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent.
 larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with a greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea.
 some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.
 respiratory system alt axolotl the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum retains its larval form with gills into adulthood the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood.
 ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping .
 most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin.
 to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.
 because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander .
 in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills.
 many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults.
 reproduction alt orange thighed frogs in amplexus male orange thighed frog litoria xanthomera grasping the female during amplexus for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist.
 a few e.
g.
 fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians.
 there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters.
 such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in two zero one zero .
 several hundred frog species in adaptive radiation s e.
g.
 eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantines the australo papuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild .
 they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free standing water.
 almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg.
 reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing.
 in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year.
 in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall.
 experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often a storm.
 in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.
 in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the phallodeum and inserting it into the female cloaca.
 the paired m llerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm.
 fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.
 the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation.
 in most of these the male deposits a spermatophore a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water.
 the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent.
 the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later.
 courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species.
 in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus .
 certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.
 with a few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation.
 the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck.
 they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm.
 roughened nuptial pads on the male s hands aid in retaining grip.
 often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming a sort of basket with the hind feet.
 an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously.
 the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation.
 the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female.
 this frog lives in fast flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.
 the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring.
 most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders.
 typically prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories.
 other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory.
 the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid.
 the females depart and territories may change hands.
 more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end.
 explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall.
 these frogs are typically species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site.
 they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season.
 the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.
 sexual selection has been studied in the red back salamander there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with.
 some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.
 life cycle most amphibians go through metamorphosis a process of significant morphological change after birth.
 in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.
 frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills.
 metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxine s effect.
 specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.
 because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances.
 for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whisker like skin extensions or fins.
 they also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish.
 after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis .
 the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made.
 eggs alt frogspawn frogspawn a mass of eggs surrounded by jelly amphibian egg one .
 jelly capsule two .
 vitelline membrane three .
 perivitelline fluid four .
 yolk plug five .
 embryo the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoprotein s and mucopolysaccharide s.
 this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water.
 the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely.
 this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised.
 eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae.
 these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis.
 they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality.
 most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation .
 caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs that lay eggs underground have unpigmented eggs.
 in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat.
 the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings.
 in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in grape like clusters in burrows near streams.
 the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots.
 the greenhouse frog eleutherodactylus planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage.
 the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs.
 first a raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally a foam cap is overlaid.
 the foam has anti microbial properties.
 it contains no detergent s but is created by whipping up protein s and lectin s secreted by the female.
 larvae alt frog spawn development early stages in the development of the embryos of the common frog rana temporaria the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults.
 in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults.
 many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies.
 some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african live bearing toads nectophrynoides spp.
 are viviparous .
 their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female s oviduct often for long periods.
 other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous .
 the eggs are retained in or on the parent s body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult.
 the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species.
 the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.
 frogs frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins.
 the free living larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semi terrestrial and live among wet rocks.
 tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line system s and large tails that they use for swimming.
 newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills.
 the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air.
 some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs.
 these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place.
 while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak.
 front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.
 amphibian metamorphosis iodine and t four over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.
 in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous .
 pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small mouths they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation.
 stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal fins they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria.
 they also feed on diatom s filtered from the water through the gill s and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments.
 they have a relatively long spiral shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet.
 some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish.
 young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking a larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.
 at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely.
 the spiral shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut.
 the animal develops a large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac.
 eyes and legs grow quickly and a tongue is formed.
 there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system.
 all this can happen in about a day.
 a few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.
 salamanders alt larva of the long toed salamander larva of the long toed salamander ambystoma macrodactylum alt larvae of the alpine newt larvae of the alpine newt ichthyosaura alpestris at hatching a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins.
 the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water.
 pond type larvae often have a pair of balancers rod like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment.
 some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations.
 the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state a condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult.
 both of these are able to breed.
 neoteny occurs when the animal s growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine.
 other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecific s.
 the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process.
 the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state.
 when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out.
 there are fifteen species of neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.
 lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter.
 each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander.
 the female salamander often broods the eggs.
 in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.
 in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs.
 this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems.
 their lungs are functional early but the larvae don t make as much use of them as do tadpoles.
 their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water.
 other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure.
 salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land.
 adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and a land phase in winter.
 for adaptation to a water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine.
 external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.
 caecilians alt ichthyophis glutinosus the caecilian ichthyophis glutinosus with eggs and developing embryo most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water.
 the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus a species from sri lanka has been much studied.
 the eel like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water.
 they have three pairs of external red feathery gills a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes a lateral line system and a short tail with fins.
 they swim by undulating their body from side to side.
 they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land.
 metamorphosis is gradual.
 by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails.
 the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments.
 by this time the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.
 alt ringed caecilian the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus resembles an earthworm in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by vivipary.
 typhlonectes compressicauda a species from south america is typical of these.
 up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time.
 they are elongated and have paired sac like gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth.
 at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct.
 this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipid s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall.
 they may increase their length sixfold and be two fifths as long as their mother before being born.
 by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth.
 a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.
 the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction.
 the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy.
 the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate.
 meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.
 parental care alt common rocket frog male common rocket frog colostethus panamensis carrying tadpoles on his back the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in a batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place.
 nevertheless it is estimated that in up to two zero of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young.
 those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.
 many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land.
 the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs.
 when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders.
 the male hellbender a primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there.
 the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.
 male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carrying eggs the male colostethus subpunctatus a tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log.
 when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by a mucous secretion to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off.
 the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks.
 he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles.
 the female gastric brooding frog rheobatrachus spp.
 reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct.
 the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply.
 the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground.
 when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs.
 the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis.
 the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae .
 its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water filled crevice such as the of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad .
 the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.
 feeding and diet alt northwestern salamander northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile eating a worm with a few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow.
 the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders.
 the sirens siren spp.
 often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet.
 the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites.
 it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front.
 food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light.
 movement of the prey triggers a feeding response.
 frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past.
 toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey.
 this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves.
 cave dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell.
 some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness.
 amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it.
 they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth a feature unique to amphibians.
 the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals.
 salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp.
 lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp.
 have no teeth.
 in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.
 alt edible frog eating a fellow edible frog edible frog pelophylax esculentus exhibiting cannibalism the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates.
 others amphibians such as the bufo spp.
 toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes.
 among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well camouflaged.
 caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward pointing teeth.
 the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow.
 the subdued prey is gulped down whole.
 when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg.
 when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants.
 water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out.
 others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth.
 they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths.
 some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.
 vocalization alt male treefrog calling male treefrog dendropsophus microcephalus inflating his air sac as he calls the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied.
 a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation as in bats or a form of communication.
 most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound.
 some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.
 american toad anaxyrus americanus singing frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates.
 the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself.
 in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth.
 this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged.
 the main vocalisation is the male s loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory.
 this call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near.
 calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy.
 other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus.
 when a frog is attacked a distress or fright call is emitted often resembling a scream.
 the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.
 territorial behaviour little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges.
 these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites.
 males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved.
 although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence.
 some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs.
 alt red backed salamander the red back salamander plethodon cinereus defends a territory against intruders.
 in salamanders defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder.
 this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of a tail.
 the behaviour of red back salamander s plethodon cinereus has been much studied.
 nine one of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre yard of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock.
 a similar proportion when moved experimentally a distance of found their way back to their home base.
 the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair.
 these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas.
 much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals.
 an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively.
 if the intruder persisted a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso labial grooves.
 damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.
 in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates.
 in general a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males.
 much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires.
 there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders.
 holders of territories have a home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar sized frogs.
 if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place.
 fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponent s vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water.
 defence mechanisms alt cane toad cane toad bufo marinus with poison glands behind the eyes amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines.
 nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive.
 the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce.
 this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip.
 the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic.
 snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frog s xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape.
 caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil.
 in some salamanders the skin is poisonous.
 the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic non protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish .
 handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly.
 in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible.
 the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis .
 in locations where both snake and salamander co exist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity.
 coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity.
 some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back.
 these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms.
 altogether over two zero zero toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.
 alt fire salamander the fire salamander salamandra salamandra a toxic species wears warning colours.
 perhaps the most poisonous animal in the world the golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis is endemic to colombia .
 poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity.
 these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example.
 once a predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal.
 in some species such as the fire bellied toad bombina spp.
 the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator.
 the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality a strategy that may deceive predators.
 many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight.
 other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected.
 they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background.
 some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern short tailed shrew blarina brevicauda .
 their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison producing granular glands.
 a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape.
 the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached.
 the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.
 some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker.
 giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite.
 the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape.
 cognition in amphibians there is evidence of habituation associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning and discrimination abilities.
 in one experiment when offered live fruit flies drosophila virilis salamanders choose the larger of one vs two and two vs three .
 frogs can distinguish between low numbers one vs two two vs three but not three vs four and large numbers three vs six four vs eight but not four vs six of prey.
 this is irrespective of other characteristics i.
e.
 surface area volume weight and movement although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area.
 conservation alt golden toad the extinct golden toad bufo periglenes last seen in one nine eight nine dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late one nine eight zero s from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity .
 in two zero zero four the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum four eight times greater than natural extinction rates possibly one zero two four times higher.
 in two zero zero six there were believed to be four zero three five species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle.
 of these one three five six three three .
 six were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes one four two seven species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status.
 a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification over exploitation pollution introduced species climate change endocrine disrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like chytridiomycosis .
 however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are a topic of ongoing discussion.
 alt hula painted frog the hula painted frog discoglossus nigriventer was believed to be extinct but was rediscovered in two zero one one .
 with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicator s.
 in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass.
 any decline in amphibian numbers will have an impact on the patterns of predation.
 the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species.
 in the middle east a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquito es.
 predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline.
 the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are diminishing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellow legged frog rana muscosa putting the snake s future at risk.
 if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it.
 meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles.
 these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom.
 a reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose.
 aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.
 a global strategy to stem the crisis was released in two zero zero five in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan.
 developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost.
 the amphibian specialist group of the world conservation union iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation.
 amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex situ conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians.
 one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create a country wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.

 regions there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are six widely accepted regions south central the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the matanuska susitna valley and the kenai peninsula .
 rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez .
 southeast also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states.
 as such this was where most of the initial non indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase .

 barrow the northernmost city in the united states is located here.
 the northwest arctic area anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley is often regarded as being part of this region.
 however the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.
 aleutian islands more than three zero zero small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches over into the pacific ocean.
 some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere but the international date line was drawn west of one eight zero to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day.
 two of the islands attu and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii.
 natural features augustine volcano erupting on january one two two zero zero six with its myriad islands alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline.
 the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula .
 many active volcano es are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions.
 unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the north pacific.
 it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth even more symmetrical than japan s mount fuji .
 the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland.

 land ownership alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state.
 according to an october one nine nine eight report by the united states bureau of land management approximately six five of alaska is owned and managed by the u.
s.
 federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuge s.
 of these the bureau of land management manages or two three .
 eight of the state.
 the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service .
 it is the world s largest wildlife refuge comprising .
 of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns its entitlement under the alaska statehood act .
 a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs.
 smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading related opportunities.
 these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.
 the university of alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.
 another are owned by one two regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa of one nine seven one .
 regional native corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications.
 provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in one nine nine one were repealed before they could take effect.
 effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual alaskans but cannot sell the land.
 individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market however.
 various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state.
 alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded.
 climate map depicting the climate zones of alaska.
 the climate in southeast alaska is a mid latitude oceanic climate k ppen climate classification cfb in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate k ppen cfc in the northern parts.
 on an annual basis southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year.
 juneau averages over of precipitation a year and ketchikan averages over .
 this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.
 the climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the region s proximity to the seacoast.
 while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer.
 on average anchorage receives of precipitation a year with around of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow.
 it is a subarctic climate k ppen dfc due to its brief cool summers.
 the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska .
 it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north.

 the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people .
 colonization some researchers believe that the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the one seven th century.
 according to this hypothesis in one six four eight several koches of semyon dezhnyov s expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement.
 this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in one seven six four one seven six five and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons .
 some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river .

 the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than eight zero of the state s revenues derived from petroleum extraction.
 alaska s main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab.
 agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy.
 agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock.
 manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.
 employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation.
 military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak.
 federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low.
 its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products.
 there is also a growing service and tourism sector.
 tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.
 energy upright the trans alaska pipeline transports oil alaska s most financially important export from the north slope to valdez .
 pertinent are the heat pipe s in the column mounts which disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of permafrost .
 alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted.
 major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february two zero one four alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california.
 prudhoe bay on alaska s north slope is still the second highest yielding oil field in the united states typically producing about although by early two zero one four north dakota s bakken formation was producing over .
 prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america but was much smaller than canada s enormous athabasca oil sands field which by two zero one four was producing about of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.
 the trans alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states.
 additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaska s bituminous sub bituminous and lignite coal basins.
 the united states geological survey estimates that there are of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope.
 alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers.
 large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.
 alaska s economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light.
 though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems e.
g.
 with special low cost electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report two zero zero one due to low less than five zero gal fuel prices long distances and low population.
 the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually three zero six zero higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.
 permanent fund the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in one nine seven six to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans alaska pipeline system .
 the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the one nine six nine prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to nine zero zero million at once.
 it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone.
 it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.
 the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.
 the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.
 from its initial principal of seven three four zero zero zero the fund has grown to five zero billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.
 most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska.
 this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum.
 starting in one nine eight two dividends from the fund s annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial one zero zero zero in one nine eight two equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to three two six nine in two zero zero eight which included a one time one two zero zero resource rebate .
 every year the state legislature takes out eight from the earnings puts three back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining five is distributed to all qualifying alaskans.
 to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of one two months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.
 the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world.
 cost of living the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous four eight states.
 federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and active duty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at two five of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country.
 rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.
 agriculture and fishing upright halibut is important to the state s economy as both a commercial and sport caught fish.
 due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska.
 most farms are in either the matanuska valley about northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about southwest of anchorage.
 the short one zero zero day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons.
 the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage.
 the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely .
 this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor.
 delta area crops consist predominately of barley and hay.
 west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and community supported agriculture .
 alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardener s small farms and farmers market s in recent years with the highest percentage increase four six in the nation in growth in farmers markets in two zero one one compared to one seven nationwide.
 the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market.
 alaska with no counties lacks county fairs.
 however a small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer.
 the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high profile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food.
 alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan.
 alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific.
 seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it.
 many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport.
 this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel.
 hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities.
 an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries.
 alaska s reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.
 most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive.
 in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive.
 though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes.
 the cost of transport can reach as high as five zero per pound one .
 one zero kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions.
 the cost of delivering a of milk is about three .
 five zero in many villages where per capita income can be two zero zero zero zero or less.
 fuel cost per gallon is routinely two zero three zero higher than the continental united states average with only hawaii having higher prices.
 transportation the sterling highway near its intersection with the seward highway .
 roads the susitna river bridge on the denali highway is long.
 alaska interstate highways .
 alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u.
s.
 the state s road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada.
 the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only a car ferry which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines .
 the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska.
 one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about southeast of anchorage at portage .
 at the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until two zero zero seven .
 the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america.

 the white pass and yukon route traverses rugged terrain north of skagway near the canadian border .
 built around one nine one five the alaska railroad arr played a key role in the development of alaska through the two zero th century.
 it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole .
 the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt .
 in recent years the ever improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad s importance in alaska s economy.
 the railroad played a vital role in alaska s development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward i.
e.
 coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage .
 it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.
 the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use caboose s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains.
 it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country.
 a stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area.

 a bombardier dash eight operated by era alaska on approach to ted stevens anchorage international airport .
 the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service .
 the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state.
 much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities.

 agricultural production systems crop cultivation systems rice cultivation at a paddy field in bihar state of india the banaue rice terraces in ifugao philippines cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.
 shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years.
 then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years one zero two zero .
 this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control .
 annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period.
 this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.
 further industrialization led to the use of monoculture s when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage.
 because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticide s and fertilizers.
 multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polyculture s.
 in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation .
 in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry .
 in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.
 crop statistics important categories of crops include cereal s and pseudocereals pulses legumes forage and fruits and vegetables.
 specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing region s throughout the world.
 in millions of metric tons based on fao estimate.
 livestock production systems ploughing rice paddies with water buffalo in indonesia animals including horses mule s ox en water buffalo camel s llama s alpaca s donkey s and dogs are often used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers.
 animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products like milk eggs or wool on a continual basis but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.
 oxen driven ploughs in india livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grassland based mixed and landless.
 three zero of earth s ice and water free area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately one .
 three billion people.
 between the one nine six zero s and the two zero zero zero s there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of one zero .
 non meat animals such as milk cows and egg producing chickens also showed significant production increases.
 global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through two zero five zero .
 aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of nine a year between one nine seven five and two zero zero seven .
 during the second half of the two zero th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breed s and crossbreed s that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity .
 this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.
 grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals.
 outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source.
 this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing three zero four zero million pastoralists.
 mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock.
 manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.
 landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the de linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic co operation and development oecd member countries.
 synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.
 industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork.
 scientists estimate that seven five of the growth in livestock production between two zero zero three and two zero three zero will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming .
 much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa.
 some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormone s are controversial.
 production practices road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices.
 farming is the practice of agriculture by specialized labor in an area primarily devoted to agricultural processes in service of a dislocated population usually in a city .
 tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control.
 tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no till .
 it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co two and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.
 pest control includes the management of weeds insect s mite s and diseases.
 chemical pesticide s biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used.
 cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crop s intercropping composting avoidance and resistance .
 integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort.
 nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock.
 nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and mined minerals .
 crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period.
 manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pasture s.
 water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.
 some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall.
 in other areas such as the great plains in the u.
s.
 and canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.
 agriculture represents seven zero of freshwater use worldwide.
 according to a report by the international food policy research institute agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by two zero five zero the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as four zero and food prices could be reduced by almost half.
 payment for ecosystem services pes can further incentivise efforts to green the agriculture sector.
 this is an approach that verifies values and rewards the benefits of ecosystem services provided by green agricultural practices.
 innovative pes measures could include reforestation payments made by cities to upstream communities in rural areas of shared watersheds for improved quantities and quality of fresh water for municipal users.
 ecoservice payments by farmers to upstream forest stewards for properly managing the flow of soil nutrients and methods to monetise the carbon sequestration and emission reduction credit benefits of green agriculture practices in order to compensate farmers for their efforts to restore and build som and employ other practices.
 crop alteration and biotechnology tractor and chaser bin crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization.
 altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds drought tolerance or resistance to pests.
 significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel .
 his work on dominant and recessive allele s although initially largely ignored for almost five zero years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques.
 crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits self pollination and cross pollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.
 domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants.
 careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants.
 plant selection and breeding in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand .
 extensive x ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts i.
e.
 primitive genetic engineering during the one nine five zero s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley.
 the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating high yielding varieties .
 for example average yields of corn maize in the usa have increased from around two .
 five tons per hectare t ha four zero bushels per acre in one nine zero zero to about nine .
 four t ha one five zero bushels per acre in two zero zero one .
 similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than one t ha in one nine zero zero to more than two .
 five t ha in one nine nine zero .
 south american average wheat yields are around two t ha african under one t ha and egypt and arabia up to three .
 five to four t ha with irrigation.
 in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over eight t ha.
 variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging .
 genetic engineering genetically modified organism s gmo are organism s whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology .
 genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops.
 increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.
 for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns.
 numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non gmo crops.
 currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos.
 there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not.
 herbicide resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosate s.
 these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop.
 herbicide tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.
 with the increasing use of herbicide tolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosate based herbicide sprays.
 in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.
 some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications.
 other gmo crops used by growers include insect resistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects.
 these crops protect plants from damage by insects.
 some believe that similar or better pest resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross pollination with wild species.
 in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least one nine diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.
 environmental impact water pollution in a rural stream due to runoff from farming activity in new zealand .
 agriculture as implemented through the method of farming imposes external costs upon society through pesticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage loss of natural environment and assorted other problems.
 a two zero zero zero assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for one nine nine six of two three four three million or two zero eight per hectare.
 a two zero zero five analysis of these costs in the usa concluded that cropland imposes approximately five to one six billion three zero to nine six per hectare while livestock production imposes seven one four million.
 both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs.
 neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.
 in two zero one zero the international resource panel of the united nations environment programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production.
 the study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions.
 the two zero one one unep green economy report states that a gricultural operations excluding land use changes produce approximately one three per cent of anthropogenic global ghg emissions.
 this includes ghgs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro chemical pesticides and herbicides ghg emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions and fossil fuel energy inputs.
 on average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second generation biofuel production amounts to three .
 eight billion tonnes per year between two zero one one and two zero five zero with an average annual growth rate of one one per cent throughout the period analysed accounting for higher growth during early years four eight per cent for two zero one one two zero two zero and an average two per cent annual expansion after two zero two zero .
 livestock issues a senior un official and co author of a un report detailing this problem henning steinfeld said livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today s most serious environmental problems .
 livestock production occupies seven zero of all land used for agriculture or three zero of the land surface of the planet.
 it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas es responsible for one eight of the world s greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co two equivalents.
 by comparison all transportation emits one three .
 five of the co two .
 it produces six five of human related nitrous oxide which has two nine six times the global warming potential of co two and three seven of all human induced methane which is two three times as warming as co two .
 it also generates six four of the ammonia emission.
 livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin seven zero of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.
 through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity.
 furthermore the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by six zero per cent by two zero three zero under current practices and consumption patterns.
 land and water issues land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earth s ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity.
 estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from three nine to five zero .
 land degradation the long term decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on two four of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented.
 the un fao report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that one .
 five billion people rely upon the degrading land.
 degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation acidification and salinization .
